## Refactoring Opportunities in the Code

Based on your request, I have analyzed the provided code snippet and identified a potential refactoring opportunity. Here's a breakdown of the identified opportunity and the refactored code:

**1. Extract Method:**

The `valueOf` method is a simple and reusable piece of logic that can be extracted into a separate method called `enumValueOf`. This would improve the readability and maintainability of the code.

**Refactored Code:**

```java
package org.junit.jupiter.params.converter;

class StringToEnumConverter implements StringToObjectConverter {

    @Override
    public boolean canConvert(Class<?> targetType) {
        return targetType.isEnum();
    }

    @Override
    public Object convert(String source, Class<?> targetType) throws Exception {
        return enumValueOf(targetType, source);
    }

    private static <T extends Enum<T>> T enumValueOf(Class<T> targetType, String source) {
        return Enum.valueOf(targetType, source);
    }

}
```

This refactoring improves the code by:

* Making the `valueOf` logic more reusable by extracting it into a separate method.
* Improving the readability of the `convert` method by removing the nested generic type and making the call to `enumValueOf` more explicit.
