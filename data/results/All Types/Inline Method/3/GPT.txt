The provided code is already simple and clean. However, there are still some **minor** refactoring opportunities that could slightly improve clarity and maintainability.

### **Refactoring Suggestions**

1. **Extract Method**  
   - The `after()` method directly calls `validateNullToStringStyleRegistry()`. Since the method name `validateNullToStringStyleRegistry()` is somewhat verbose, the validation logic could be moved into a more descriptive method.  
   - Alternatively, the assertion can be directly placed in the `after()` method, making the validation clearer.

2. **Rename Method**  
   - The method name `validateNullToStringStyleRegistry()` can be renamed to something shorter and clearer like `assertToStringStyleRegistryIsNull()` to better reflect its behavior.

3. **Rename Variable/Attribute**  
   - The term **"Registry"** might be vague. If possible, renaming it to something more descriptive (if the context allows) could be more helpful, but since it refers to a third-party library, it's acceptable as is.

4. **Inline Method**  
   - Since `validateNullToStringStyleRegistry()` is only called once, it could be inlined within `after()` to reduce unnecessary abstraction.

### **Refactored Code**

```java
package org.apache.commons.lang3;

import static org.junit.jupiter.api.Assertions.assertNull;

import org.apache.commons.lang3.builder.ToStringStyle;
import org.junit.jupiter.api.AfterEach;

/**
 * All tests subclass this test.
 */
public class AbstractLangTest {

    /**
     * Ensures that the {@link ToStringStyle} registry is cleared after each test.
     */
    @AfterEach
    public void validateToStringStyleRegistryIsEmpty() {
        assertNull(ToStringStyle.getRegistry(), "Expected null, actual: " + ToStringStyle.getRegistry());
    }
}
```

---

### **Summary of Changes**

1. **Rename Method**:  
   - Renamed `after()` to `validateToStringStyleRegistryIsEmpty()` for clarity.  

2. **Inline Method**:  
   - Removed the `validateNullToStringStyleRegistry()` method and inlined the assertion directly in the `@AfterEach` method.

3. **Improved Documentation**:  
   - Updated the comment to better describe the purpose of the method.

---

### **Justification**  
- These changes make the code slightly clearer and more self-explanatory.  
- Since the validation is simple, keeping everything in one method improves readability.  

If you prefer keeping the validation logic separate, I can adjust accordingly.
