The given code snippet is well-structured and concise. However, there are some minor refactoring opportunities that could improve code maintainability and readability.

### Refactoring Suggestions:
1. **Extracting the common assertions**: The assertions in the tests are repetitive, and extracting them into a helper method can reduce redundancy.
2. **Naming conventions**: The method names and variables are clear, so there’s no need for renaming.
3. **Avoid unnecessary resource initialization**: The `try-with-resources` can be avoided for the singleton case since `CLOSED_INPUT_STREAM` and `INSTANCE` are constants.

### Refactored Code:
```java
package org.apache.commons.io.input;

import static org.apache.commons.io.IOUtils.EOF;
import static org.junit.jupiter.api.Assertions.assertEquals;

import org.junit.jupiter.api.Test;

/**
 * Tests {@link ClosedInputStream}.
 */
public class ClosedInputStreamTest {

    private void assertEOF(ClosedInputStream cis) throws Exception {
        assertEquals(EOF, cis.read(), "read()");
    }

    @Test
    public void testRead() throws Exception {
        try (ClosedInputStream cis = new ClosedInputStream()) {
            assertEOF(cis);
        }
    }

    @Test
    public void testReadArray() throws Exception {
        try (ClosedInputStream cis = new ClosedInputStream()) {
            assertEOF(cis.read(new byte[4096]));
            assertEOF(cis.read(new byte[1]));
            assertEOF(cis.read(new byte[0]));
        }
    }

    @Test
    public void testReadArrayIndex() throws Exception {
        try (ClosedInputStream cis = new ClosedInputStream()) {
            assertEOF(cis.read(new byte[4096], 0, 1));
            assertEOF(cis.read(new byte[1], 0, 1));
            assertEOF(cis.read(new byte[0], 0, 0));
        }
    }

    @Test
    public void testSingleton() throws Exception {
        // No need for try-with-resources here, as CLOSED_INPUT_STREAM and INSTANCE are constants
        ClosedInputStream cis = ClosedInputStream.CLOSED_INPUT_STREAM;
        assertEOF(cis);
        
        cis = ClosedInputStream.INSTANCE;
        assertEOF(cis);
    }
}
```

### Explanation of Refactorings:
1. **Extracted common assertions**: I created the helper method `assertEOF(ClosedInputStream cis)` to avoid repeating the `assertEquals(EOF, cis.read(), "read()")` in each test method.
2. **Removed unnecessary `try-with-resources` for singletons**: Since the `CLOSED_INPUT_STREAM` and `INSTANCE` are constants, they don’t need to be wrapped in a `try-with-resources` block. This change avoids unnecessary resource management code for constants.

### Conclusion:
The refactored code is more maintainable and readable, but the original code was already well-structured.
