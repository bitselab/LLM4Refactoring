## Refactoring Opportunities in TermsHashPerField

Based on your provided code snippet, here are some potential refactoring opportunities:

**1. Extract Variable:**

* The variable `postingsArray` is accessed multiple times within the class. It can be extracted into a local variable for better readability and efficiency.
* The variable `termStreamAddressBuffer` is also accessed multiple times and can be extracted for similar reasons.

**2. Extract Method:**

* The `allocSlice` and `allocKnownSizeSlice` methods share a lot of common code and can be combined into a single method called `allocateSlice`.
* The `writeVInt` method can be extracted into a separate utility class for better code organization.

**3. Inline Method:**

* The `positionStreamSlice` method is a simple method that can be inlined directly into the `add` method.

**4. Rename Method:**

* The method `start` can be renamed to `begin` for better clarity.
* The method `newTerm` can be renamed to `initTerm` for better consistency with the rest of the code.

**5. Rename Variable:**

* The variable `doNextCall` can be renamed to `hasSubsequentField` for better readability.
* The variable `streamCount` can be renamed to `numStreams` for better clarity.

**6. Rename Parameter:**

* The parameter `textStart` in the `add` method can be renamed to `termAddress` for better consistency with the rest of the code.

**7. Inline Variable:**

* The variable `lastDocID` is only used once and can be inlined directly into the `assertDocId` method.

**8. Extract Class:**

* The `PostingsBytesStartArray` inner class can be extracted into a separate class for better modularity and reusability.

**9. Use Interface:**

* The abstract methods `newTerm`, `addTerm`, and `newPostingsArray` can be replaced with an interface for better abstraction and flexibility.

**Refactored Code:**

/**
 * This class stores streams of information per term without knowing the size of the stream ahead of
 * time. Each stream typically encodes one level of information like term frequency per document or
 * term proximity. Internally this class allocates a linked list of slices that can be read by a
 * {@link ByteSliceReader} for each term. Terms are first deduplicated in a {@link BytesRefHash}
 * once this is done internal data-structures point to the current offset of each stream that can be
 * written to.
