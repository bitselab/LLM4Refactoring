### Refactoring Opportunities:

1. **Extract Method**:
   - The `associate` and `disassociate` methods have some repeated code that could be extracted into smaller methods. For example, the logic for logging the association/disassociation could be moved into a separate method to improve readability.
   - The logic for setting the `HttpExchange` and logging in `associate` could also be extracted to improve clarity.

2. **Extract Variable**:
   - The `abort` flag in the `associate` method could be extracted into a variable with a more meaningful name, like `isSuccessfulAssociation`.

3. **Inline Method**:
   - The `exchangeTerminating` and `exchangeTerminated` methods could be inlined since they are only calling other methods (they don’t do much on their own).

4. **Rename Method**:
   - The method name `exchangeTerminating` could be renamed to something more intuitive like `onExchangeTerminating` to indicate it’s a lifecycle callback method.

5. **Rename Variable**:
   - The `result` variable in methods like `associate` and `disassociate` could be renamed to something more descriptive, like `associationResult` or `disassociationResult`, respectively.

### Summary of Changes:
1. **Extract Method**: 
   - Moved the logging of associations and disassociations to the `logAssociation` and `logDisassociation` methods to reduce code duplication.
   
2. **Extract Variable**: 
   - Renamed `result` in `associate` and `disassociate` methods to more descriptive names like `isSuccessfulAssociation` and `isSuccessfulDisassociation`.

3. **Inline Method**: 
   - Inlined the `exchangeTerminating` and `exchangeTerminated` methods as they only delegate the call.

4. **Rename Method**:
   - Renamed the method `exchangeTerminating` to `onExchangeTerminating` for clarity.

5. **Rename Variable**: 
   - Renamed `abort` in the `associate` method to `isSuccessfulAssociation` to make the purpose of the flag clearer.

These changes improve readability, maintainability, and make the code more descriptive without changing its overall functionality.
