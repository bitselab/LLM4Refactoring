In the given code snippet, the attribute `MAX_CAPACITY` is identified for renaming. The goal of renaming attributes is to ensure that the name accurately and clearly represents the purpose and function of the attribute in the context of the code.

The name `MAX_CAPACITY` is somewhat generic and could be more descriptive. Since this constant is used to define the maximum capacity of a cache in the `RetryCache` class, a more descriptive name could be `MAX_CACHE_CAPACITY`. This name clearly indicates that the capacity is specifically for the cache and not for some other component or generic purpose.

Here's the refactored code with the attribute renamed:

```java
package org.apache.hadoop.ipc;

// ... [other imports]

@InterfaceAudience.Private
public class RetryCache {
    public static final Logger LOG = LoggerFactory.getLogger(RetryCache.class);
    private static final int MAX_CACHE_CAPACITY = 16; // Renamed from MAX_CAPACITY to MAX_CACHE_CAPACITY
    private final RetryCacheMetrics retryCacheMetrics;

    // ... [other attributes and methods of RetryCache]

    // Inner classes and other methods remain unchanged
    // ...

    public RetryCache(String cacheName, double percentage, long expirationTime) {
        int capacity = LightWeightGSet.computeCapacity(percentage, cacheName);
        capacity = Math.max(capacity, MAX_CACHE_CAPACITY);
        this.set = new LightWeightCache<CacheEntry, CacheEntry>(capacity, capacity,
                expirationTime, 0);
        this.expirationTime = expirationTime;
        this.cacheName = cacheName;
        this.retryCacheMetrics = RetryCacheMetrics.create(this);
    }

    // ... [other methods]
}
```

This change enhances the clarity of the code by making the purpose of `MAX_CACHE_CAPACITY` more specific and immediately understandable to anyone reading the code. It is important to ensure that this renamed constant is also updated in any other places within the codebase where it is used, to maintain consistency and avoid errors.
