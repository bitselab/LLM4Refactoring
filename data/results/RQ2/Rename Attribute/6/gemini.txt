Absolutely! Here's the refactored code with a more descriptive attribute name:

```java
package org.apache.hadoop.ipc;

// ... (other imports)

public class RetryCache {
    public static final Logger LOG = LoggerFactory.getLogger(RetryCache.class);
    private final RetryCacheMetrics retryCacheMetrics;
    // Renamed attribute for better clarity
    private static final int MAXIMUM_CACHE_CAPACITY = 16;

    // ... (other attributes)

    // ... (other code)
}
```

The original `MAX_CAPACITY` attribute has been renamed to `MAXIMUM_CACHE_CAPACITY`. This new name is more descriptive and clarifies the attribute's purpose within the `RetryCache` class.

Here's a breakdown of the benefits of this refactoring:

- **Improved Readability:** The new name is clearer and easier to understand for developers working with the codebase.
- **Self-Documenting:** The name conveys the attribute's meaning without requiring additional comments.
- **Maintainability:** A more descriptive name makes the code easier to modify and update in the future.

By using descriptive attribute names, you can enhance the overall quality and maintainability of your code.
