 **Here's the refactored code with a more descriptive attribute name:**

```java
package org.apache.flink.streaming.runtime.tasks;

// ... (other imports)

public class StreamMockEnvironment implements Environment {

    private final JobInfo jobInformation;  // Renamed attribute for better clarity

    // ... (other attributes)

    public StreamMockEnvironment(
            // ... (constructor arguments)
    ) {
        // ... (constructor code)
        this.jobInformation = new JobInfoImpl(jobID, "mock");
        // ... (other initializations)
    }

    // ... (other constructors and methods)

    @Override
    public JobInfo getJobInfo() {
        return jobInformation;  // Use the renamed attribute
    }
}
```

**Key points about this refactoring:**

- **Clarity:** The name `jobInformation` more accurately conveys the attribute's purpose of storing information about the job.
- **Consistency:** It aligns with common naming conventions, using a descriptive noun for clarity.
- **Readability:** The code becomes easier to understand for those less familiar with the codebase.
- **Maintainability:** Clearer names make it easier to modify and update the code in the future.

**Remember to update any references to the old attribute name throughout the codebase as well!**
