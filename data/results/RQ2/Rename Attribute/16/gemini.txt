 **Here's the refactored code with a more descriptive attribute name:**

```java
package org.springframework.validation;

import java.beans.ConstructorProperties;
import java.util.Map;
import java.util.Optional;
import java.util.Set;

import jakarta.validation.constraints.NotNull;
import org.junit.jupiter.api.Test;

import org.springframework.core.ResolvableType;
import org.springframework.format.support.DefaultFormattingConversionService;
import org.springframework.lang.Nullable;
import org.springframework.util.Assert;

import static org.assertj.core.api.Assertions.assertThat;

/**
 * Unit tests for {@link DataBinder} with constructor binding.
 *
 * @author Rossen Stoyanchev
 */
public class DataBinderConstructTests {

    // ... other code remains unchanged

    private static class MapValueResolver implements DataBinder.ValueResolver {

        private final Map<String, Object> resolvedValues;  // Renamed attribute for clarity

        private MapValueResolver(Map<String, Object> map) {
            this.resolvedValues = map;  // Updated constructor to use the new name
        }

        // ... other code remains unchanged

        @Override
        public Object resolveValue(String name, Class<?> type) {
            return resolvedValues.get(name);  // Use the new attribute name
        }

        @Override
        public Set<String> getNames() {
            return this.resolvedValues.keySet();  // Use the new attribute name
        }
    }
}
```

**Explanation of the changes:**

1. **Renamed attribute:** The attribute `values` has been renamed to `resolvedValues` to better convey its purpose as a map containing resolved values for data binding.
2. **Constructor update:** The constructor of `MapValueResolver` has been updated to use the new attribute name `resolvedValues`.
3. **Usage updates:** The references to the attribute within the `resolveValue` and `getNames` methods have also been updated to use the new name `resolvedValues`.

**Benefits of the refactoring:**

- **Improved readability:** The new attribute name provides a clearer understanding of its role within the class, making the code easier to read and maintain.
- **Consistency:** Using a more descriptive name aligns with best practices for naming attributes, promoting consistency and clarity across the codebase.

**Additional considerations for refactoring:**

- **Variable usage:** Carefully examine how the attribute is used throughout the codebase to ensure that all references are updated accurately.
- **Naming conventions:** Adhere to established naming conventions in your project or team to maintain consistency and readability.
- **Code comments:** If necessary, update any code comments that refer to the renamed attribute to maintain accuracy and clarity.
