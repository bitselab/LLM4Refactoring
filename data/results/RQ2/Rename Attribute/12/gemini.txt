 **Here's the refactored code with a more descriptive attribute name:**

```java
package org.eclipse.jgit.revwalk;

// ... (imports remain the same) ...

public final class BitmapWalker {

  // ... (other attributes remain the same) ...

  /**
   * An empty listener that does not perform any actions.
   * Used when no events need to be tracked during the walk.
   */
  public static final BitmapWalkListener NOOP_LISTENER = new BitmapWalkListener() {
    @Override
    public void onCommitSeen(ObjectId oid) {
      // Nothing to do
    }

    @Override
    public void onCommitWithBitmap(ObjectId oid) {
      // Nothing to do
    }

    @Override
    public void onCommitWithoutBitmap(ObjectId oid) {
      // Nothing to do
    }
  };

  // ... (other methods remain the same) ...
}
```

**Changes made:**

- The attribute `NO_LISTENER` has been renamed to `NOOP_LISTENER`. This name clarifies that it's a listener that does not perform any operations (a "no-op" listener).

**Benefits of this refactoring:**

- **Improved readability:** The new name explicitly conveys the purpose of the attribute, making the code easier to understand.
- **Consistency:** Using well-established naming conventions like "noop" (no operation) enhances code clarity and maintainability.

While "NO_LISTENER" technically indicated inaction, "NOOP_LISTENER" aligns better with common practice and leaves no ambiguity about its role.
