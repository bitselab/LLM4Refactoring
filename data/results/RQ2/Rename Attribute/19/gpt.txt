In the given code snippet, the attribute `certificates` is used to represent a `Supplier` of a list of `X509Certificate` objects. While the name `certificates` is not necessarily low-quality, it could potentially be misleading because it sounds like a direct collection of certificates, not a supplier that provides them. To improve clarity, we can rename this attribute to reflect its actual purpose more accurately.

A suitable renaming would be `certificatesSupplier`, which clearly indicates that this attribute is a supplier for certificates, not the certificates themselves. This minor change can enhance the readability and understanding of the code.

Refactored Code with Renamed Attribute:

```java
package org.springframework.boot.ssl.pem;

import java.io.IOException;
import java.io.UncheckedIOException;
import java.security.PrivateKey;
import java.security.cert.X509Certificate;
import java.util.List;
import java.util.function.Supplier;

import org.springframework.util.Assert;
import org.springframework.util.CollectionUtils;
import org.springframework.util.function.SingletonSupplier;
import org.springframework.util.function.ThrowingSupplier;

final class LoadedPemSslStore implements PemSslStore {

    private final PemSslStoreDetails details;

    private final Supplier<List<X509Certificate>> certificatesSupplier; // Renamed from 'certificates'

    private final Supplier<PrivateKey> privateKeySupplier;

    LoadedPemSslStore(PemSslStoreDetails details) {
        Assert.notNull(details, "Details must not be null");
        this.details = details;
        this.certificatesSupplier = supplier(() -> loadCertificates(details)); // Updated usage
        this.privateKeySupplier = supplier(() -> loadPrivateKey(details));
    }

    private static <T> Supplier<T> supplier(ThrowingSupplier<T> supplier) {
        return SingletonSupplier.of(supplier.throwing(LoadedPemSslStore::asUncheckedIOException));
    }

    // ... [rest of the code remains unchanged]

    @Override
    public List<X509Certificate> certificates() {
        return this.certificatesSupplier.get(); // Updated usage
    }

    // ... [rest of the code remains unchanged]
}
```

### Key Changes:
- Renamed `certificates` to `certificatesSupplier`.
- Updated all usages of the renamed attribute.

This renaming makes it clearer that `certificatesSupplier` is a `Supplier` that provides a list of `X509Certificate` objects, enhancing the code's readability and maintainability.
