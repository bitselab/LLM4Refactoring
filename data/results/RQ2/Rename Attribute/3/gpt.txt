To improve the readability and clarity of the code, we will focus on renaming the `objectsEquals` attribute. A more descriptive name would enhance understanding of its purpose in the code. The name `objectsEquals` suggests a state, but it's more appropriate to use a name that indicates this is a condition being checked.

Suggested rename: `areObjectsEqual`

This name change makes it clear that the attribute is used to store the result of an equality check between two objects. Here's the refactored code with this change:

```java
package org.apache.commons.lang3.builder;

// ... [other imports remain unchanged]

public class DiffBuilder<T> implements Builder<DiffResult<T>> {

    // ... [other class members and methods remain unchanged]

    private final boolean areObjectsEqual; // Renamed attribute

    public DiffBuilder(final T lhs, final T rhs, final ToStringStyle style, final boolean testObjectsEquals) {
        this.left = Objects.requireNonNull(lhs, "lhs");
        this.right = Objects.requireNonNull(rhs, "rhs");
        this.diffs = new ArrayList<>();
        this.toStringFormat = DiffBuilder.TO_STRING_FORMAT;
        this.style = style != null ? style : ToStringStyle.DEFAULT_STYLE;
        this.areObjectsEqual = testObjectsEquals && Objects.equals(lhs, rhs); // Usage of renamed attribute
    }

    // ... [rest of the methods remain unchanged, applying the renamed variable where necessary]

    @Override
    public DiffResult<T> build() {
        return new DiffResult<>(left, right, diffs, style, toStringFormat);
    }

    // ... [rest of the class remains unchanged]
}
```

This simple renaming enhances the code's readability, making it easier for future developers to understand the role of this attribute in the context of `DiffBuilder`. Additionally, it aligns with common Java naming conventions for boolean variables and conditions.
