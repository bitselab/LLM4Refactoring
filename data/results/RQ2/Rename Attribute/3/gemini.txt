 **I'm ready to assist with refactoring the code, but I'll need more context first. Could you please provide:**

**Refactoring Goals:**

- What specific improvements are you aiming for (readability, maintainability, performance, etc.)?
- Are there any particular issues or concerns you'd like to address in the existing code?

**Constraints and Considerations:**

- Are there any limitations or dependencies to keep in mind?
- Are there coding standards or conventions to adhere to?
- Are tests in place to ensure changes don't introduce bugs?

**Scope of Refactoring:**

- Should I focus on specific areas of the code, or is a broader refactoring needed?

**Additional Information:**

- Any background or context about the code's purpose and usage would be helpful.
- Are test cases available to guide refactoring efforts?

**Once I have this information, I can offer specific refactoring recommendations tailored to your needs.**

**General Observations Based on Provided Code:**

- Consider potential for **extracting methods** to improve readability and reduce code duplication.
- Explore **replacing conditional blocks with polymorphism** for cleaner logic and better maintainability.
- Reassess **object type checks and conditional logic** for potential simplification or optimization.
- Consider **renaming variables and methods** for greater clarity and consistency.
- Evaluate the use of **Suppliers** for lazy value retrieval and potential efficiency gains.
- Ensure **proper indentation and formatting** for better readability.

**I'm ready to provide more specific guidance as soon as I have a clearer understanding of your refactoring objectives and constraints.**
