Certainly! Here's the refactored code with a more descriptive attribute name:

```java
package org.eclipse.jetty.websocket.core.client;

// ... (imports remain the same) ...

public class WebSocketCoreClient extends ContainerLifeCycle {

  public static final String WEBSOCKET_CORECLIENT_ATTRIBUTE = WebSocketCoreClient.class.getName();

  private static final Logger LOG = LoggerFactory.getLogger(WebSocketCoreClient.class);
  private final HttpClient underlyingHttpClient; // Renamed attribute
  private final WebSocketComponents components;
  private ClassLoader classLoader;

  // ... (Constructors remain the same) ...

  public HttpClient getUnderlyingHttpClient() { // Renamed getter
    return underlyingHttpClient;
  }

  // ... (other methods remain the same) ...
}
```

**Changes made:**

- The attribute `httpClient` has been renamed to `underlyingHttpClient`. This name clarifies that it's the underlying HTTP client used for WebSocket connections.
- The getter method for the attribute has also been renamed to `getUnderlyingHttpClient` to maintain consistency. 

**Benefits of this refactoring:**

- **Improved readability:** The new name explicitly states the purpose of the attribute, making the code easier to understand.
- **Enhanced maintainability:** More descriptive names make code easier to modify and update in the future.

While "httpClient" is technically accurate, "underlyingHttpClient" provides more context and clarifies its role within the WebSocketCoreClient class.
