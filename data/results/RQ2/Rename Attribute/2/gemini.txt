 **Here's the refactored code with a more descriptive attribute name:**

```java
package org.apache.commons.io.input;

// ... other imports

public class BoundedInputStream extends ProxyInputStream {

  // ... other class elements

  /**
   * The maximum allowed number of bytes to read.
   */
  private final long maximumByteCount = EOF;

  // ... remaining code using `maximumByteCount` instead of `maxLength`
}
```

**Explanation of the changes:**

1. **Renaming attribute:** The attribute `maxLength` has been renamed to `maximumByteCount`. This new name is more descriptive and accurately reflects its purpose of representing the maximum number of bytes that can be read.
2. **Consistent usage:** All occurrences of `maxLength` in the code have been replaced with `maximumByteCount` to ensure consistency.

**Key improvements:**

- **Readability:** The more descriptive name `maximumByteCount` makes the code easier to understand and maintain.
- **Clarity:** The code's intent is immediately clear to other developers who read it.
- **Self-documentation:** The name serves as a reminder of the attribute's purpose, reducing the need for additional comments.

**Additional refactoring suggestions:**

- **Consider removing redundant comments:** If the code is already clear, removing redundant comments can make it more concise.
- **Explore using constants for default values:** Constants can improve readability and make it easier to modify default values in the future.
- **Consider using a more descriptive class name:** If appropriate, a more descriptive class name could further improve code readability.
