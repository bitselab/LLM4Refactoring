 **Here's the refactored code with the extracted variable:**

```java
public void onRefresh(RefreshEvent event, RefreshContext refreshedAlready) {
    final EventSource source = event.getSession();
    final PersistenceContext persistenceContext = source.getPersistenceContextInternal();
    final Object object = event.getObject();

    if (persistenceContext.reassociateIfUninitializedProxy(object)) {
        final LazyInitializer lazyInitializer = HibernateProxy.extractLazyInitializer(object);
        final EntityPersister persister = source.getEntityPersister(lazyInitializer.getEntityName(), object);

        // Extracted variable for improved readability:
        boolean isTransientObject = isTransient(event, source, object);

        refresh(
                event,
                null,
                source,
                persister,
                lazyInitializer,
                null,
                persister.getIdentifier(object, event.getSession()),
                persistenceContext
        );

        if (isTransientObject) {
            source.setReadOnly(object, source.isDefaultReadOnly());
        }
    } else {
        final Object entity = persistenceContext.unproxyAndReassociate(object);
        if (refreshedAlready.add(entity)) {
            refresh(event, refreshedAlready, entity);
        } else {
            LOG.trace("Already refreshed");
        }
    }
}
```

**Explanation of the Refactoring:**

1. **Identified the Expression:** The expression `isTransient(event, source, object)` was used twice within the conditional block, making it a good candidate for extraction.
2. **Extracted the Variable:** The expression was extracted into a new boolean variable named `isTransientObject` placed before the `refresh` method call.
3. **Replaced the Expression:** The original occurrences of the expression were replaced with the newly created variable.

**Benefits of This Refactoring:**

- **Improved Readability:** The code becomes more readable by giving a descriptive name to the expression, clarifying its intent.
- **Reduced Redundancy:** The calculation of the expression is performed only once, saving resources and potentially improving performance.
- **Enhanced Maintainability:** The code becomes easier to understand and modify, as changes to the logic only need to be made in one place.
