The `recordInvocation` method in the `AutoCloseSpy` class can be improved with extract variable refactoring. The expression `this.prefix + this.invokedMethod` is used multiple times, which is a clear indication that it can be extracted into a local variable. This not only makes the code cleaner but also avoids potential errors in maintaining or changing the same string concatenation in multiple places.

Here's the refactored `recordInvocation` method:

```java
private void recordInvocation(String methodName) {
    if (this.invokedMethod != null) {
        throw new IllegalStateException("Already closed via " + this.invokedMethod);
    }
    this.invokedMethod = methodName;
    
    // Extracted variable
    String fullMethodName = this.prefix + this.invokedMethod;

    recorder.add(fullMethodName);

    if (this.fail) {
        throw new RuntimeException(fullMethodName);
    }
}
```

In this refactoring:
- The repeated concatenation `this.prefix + this.invokedMethod` is replaced with a single variable `fullMethodName`.
- This change enhances the readability of the code and makes it easier to maintain or modify the concatenated string in the future.
