**3. Potential Refactoring Approaches (General):**

- **Extract Method:** Isolate segments of code into separate, reusable methods for clarity and organization.
- **Encapsulate Field:** Protect fields within classes using getter and setter methods to promote data integrity and encapsulation.
- **Introduce Parameter Object:** Group related fields into a cohesive object to enhance readability and reduce parameter lists.
- **Replace Temp with Query:** Eliminate temporary variables by crafting concise expressions for clarity.
- **Decompose Conditional:** Break down complex conditional logic into smaller, manageable blocks for improved readability and maintainability.
- **Consolidate Duplicate Conditional Fragments:** Merge identical conditional code segments for efficiency and consistency.
- **Remove Assignments to Parameters:** Avoid directly modifying parameters, as this can lead to unexpected side effects.
