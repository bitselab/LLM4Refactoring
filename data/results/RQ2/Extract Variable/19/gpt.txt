Certainly! Applying the "Extract Variable" refactoring technique to the `getStartLogMessage` method in the provided code will improve its readability. This technique involves creating a new variable to hold the result of the complex expression `StringUtils.hasText(this.contextPath) ? this.contextPath : "/"`. By doing so, we make the code more readable and easier to understand.

Here's the refactored `getStartLogMessage` method:

```java
@Override
protected String getStartLogMessage() {
    String resolvedContextPath = StringUtils.hasText(this.contextPath) ? this.contextPath : "/";
    StringBuilder message = new StringBuilder(super.getStartLogMessage());
    message.append(" with context path '");
    message.append(resolvedContextPath);
    message.append("'");
    return message.toString();
}
```

In this refactored method, `resolvedContextPath` is the extracted variable. It holds the value of the context path after checking if it has text. This makes the concatenation part in the `StringBuilder` more straightforward and the intent of the code clearer.
