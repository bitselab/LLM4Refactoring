Here's the refactored code with the extracted variable:

```java
package org.eclipse.jetty.client;

import org.eclipse.jetty.client.api.Connection;
import org.eclipse.jetty.client.api.Result;
import org.eclipse.jetty.io.CyclicTimeouts;
import org.eclipse.jetty.util.thread.AutoLock;
import org.slf4j.Logger;
import org.slf4j.LoggerFactory;

public abstract class HttpChannel implements CyclicTimeouts.Expirable {

    private static final Logger LOG = LoggerFactory.getLogger(HttpChannel.class);

    private final AutoLock _lock = new AutoLock();
    private final HttpDestination _destination;
    private HttpExchange _exchange;

    protected HttpChannel(HttpDestination destination) {
        _destination = destination;
    }

    public void destroy() {
    }

    public HttpDestination getHttpDestination() {
        return _destination;
    }

    /**
     * Associates the given {@code exchange} to this channel in order to be sent over the network.
     * <p>
     * If the association is successful, the exchange can be sent. Otherwise, the channel must be
     * disposed because whoever terminated the exchange did not do it - it did not have the channel yet.
     *
     * @param exchange the exchange to associate
     * @return true if the association was successful, false otherwise
     */
    public boolean associate(HttpExchange exchange) {
        boolean result = false;
        boolean abort = true;
        try (AutoLock ignored = _lock.lock()) {
            if (_exchange == null) {
                abort = false;
                result = exchange.associate(this);
                if (result) {
                    _exchange = exchange;
                }
            }
        }

        if (abort) {
            exchange.getRequest().abort(new UnsupportedOperationException("Pipelined requests not supported"));
        } else {
            HttpRequest request = exchange.getRequest(); // Extracted variable
            request.setConnection(getConnection());
            if (LOG.isDebugEnabled())
                LOG.debug("{} associated {} to {}", exchange, result, this);
        }

        return result;
    }

    // ... rest of the code

}
```

**Explanation of the changes:**

1. **Extract variable:** The expression `exchange.getRequest()` was repeated twice within the `if` block. It has been encapsulated in a new variable named `request`.
2. **Replace with variable:** The original occurrences of `exchange.getRequest()` have been replaced with the new variable `request`.

**Benefits of this refactoring:**

- **Improved readability:** The code is easier to read and understand because the purpose of the expression is now clearer.
- **Reduced redundancy:** Eliminating duplicate code makes the code more concise and less prone to errors.
- **Enhanced maintainability:** Changes to the logic of getting the request object only need to be made in one place, making maintenance easier.
