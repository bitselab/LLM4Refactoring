 **I'm ready to help you with refactoring the code, but I'll need more information about the specific goals and constraints to provide the most effective guidance. Please provide details on:**

- **Refactoring Objectives:**
    - What specific improvements are you aiming for (e.g., readability, maintainability, performance, testability, modularity, etc.)?
    - Are there any particular patterns or techniques you'd like to apply?
- **Constraints:**
    - Are there any limitations or considerations to keep in mind (e.g., compatibility with existing systems, coding standards, project deadlines, etc.)?
- **Focus Areas:**
    - Do you have specific parts of the code you'd like to prioritize for refactoring?
- **Testing:**
    - What testing strategies are in place to ensure code quality and functionality after refactoring?

**Here are some general observations and potential areas to explore for refactoring, but their prioritization will depend on your specific goals:**

- **Break down large methods:** 
      - Consider dividing the `processFiles` method into smaller, more focused functions for each distinct step.
- **Extract common code:** 
      - Identify code patterns that could be refactored into reusable functions or classes to reduce redundancy and improve maintainability (e.g., file extension validation, file path handling, etc.).
- **Introduce design patterns:** 
      - Consider using patterns appropriate for the context, such as the Strategy pattern for handling different file processing strategies or the Observer pattern for managing listeners more effectively.
- **Improve error handling:** 
      - Refine error messages for better clarity and potentially handle errors more gracefully based on severity or context.
- **Enhance logging:** 
      - Consider logging additional information for debugging and auditing purposes, such as file paths being processed and timestamps.
- **Consider using configuration files:** 
      - Evaluate the possibility of using configuration files for settings like `fileExtensions`, `basedir`, and `tabWidth` to improve flexibility and avoid hardcoding.

**While I cannot directly edit code, I can provide detailed refactoring recommendations and rationale once you furnish the requested information.**
