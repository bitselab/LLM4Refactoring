Certainly! The goal of the extract variable refactoring is to enhance code readability and reduce redundancy by introducing a new variable to store the result of a repeated expression. In the given method `getSomeRoot`, the expression `getPathFromClass(klass)` is called multiple times. This can be refactored by extracting this repeated expression into a local variable. 

Here's the refactored version of the `getSomeRoot` method:

```java
private static Path getSomeRoot(Class<?> klass) {
    // Under jps-bootstrap home is already known, reuse it
    String communityHome = System.getenv(JPS_BOOTSTRAP_COMMUNITY_HOME_ENV_NAME);
    if (communityHome != null) {
        return Path.of(communityHome).normalize();
    }

    Path classPath = getPathFromClass(klass); // Extracted variable

    if (!classPath.toString().endsWith("class")) {
        throw new IllegalArgumentException(
                String.format("To guess idea home, you must provide class that resides in .class file inside of idea home dir. " +
                        "But provided %s resides in %s", klass, classPath));
    }
    return classPath;
}
```

In this refactored code, `getPathFromClass(klass)` is called only once, and its result is stored in a new variable `classPath`. This variable is then used in subsequent operations, which makes the code more readable and slightly more efficient.
