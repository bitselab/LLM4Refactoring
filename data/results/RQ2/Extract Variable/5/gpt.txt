The extract variable refactoring is intended to make the code more readable and maintainable by reducing complexity and repetition. In the `testMaxAttempts` method, the expression `new ManualClock()` is repeated, which is a good candidate for this refactoring. We can extract this repeated instantiation of `ManualClock` into a single variable at the start of the method. This makes the code cleaner and avoids unnecessary object creation.

Here's the refactored version of the `testMaxAttempts` method:

```java
void testMaxAttempts() {
    int maxAttempts = 13;
    long maxBackoffMS = 3L;
    ManualClock clock = new ManualClock();
    final ExponentialDelayRestartBackoffTimeStrategy restartStrategy =
            new ExponentialDelayRestartBackoffTimeStrategy(
                    clock, 1L, maxBackoffMS, 1.2, 10L, 0.25, maxAttempts);

    for (int i = 0; i <= maxAttempts; i++) {
        assertThat(restartStrategy.canRestart()).isTrue();
        restartStrategy.notifyFailure(failure);
        clock.advanceTime(Duration.ofMillis(maxBackoffMS + 1));
    }
    assertThat(restartStrategy.canRestart()).isFalse();
}
```

In this refactored code:
- A new `ManualClock` object is created once at the beginning of the method and assigned to the variable `clock`.
- This `clock` variable is then used both in the instantiation of `ExponentialDelayRestartBackoffTimeStrategy` and in the `advanceTime` call inside the loop.
- This change reduces the creation of redundant `ManualClock` instances and improves the clarity of the code. 

This approach should be applied to other test methods in the class where similar patterns of repeated object creation are found.
