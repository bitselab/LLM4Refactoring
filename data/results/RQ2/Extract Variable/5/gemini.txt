 **Here's the refactored code with the extracted variable:**

```java
void testMaxAttempts() {
    int maxAttempts = 13;
    long maxBackoffMS = 3L;
    final ExponentialDelayRestartBackoffTimeStrategy restartStrategy =
            new ExponentialDelayRestartBackoffTimeStrategy(
                    new ManualClock(), 1L, maxBackoffMS, 1.2, 10L, 0.25, maxAttempts);

  // Extract the repeated expression into a variable
  ManualClock clock = new ManualClock();

    for (int i = 0; i <= maxAttempts; i++) {
        assertThat(restartStrategy.canRestart()).isTrue();
        restartStrategy.notifyFailure(failure);
        clock.advanceTime(Duration.ofMillis(maxBackoffMS + 1)); // Use the extracted variable
    }
    assertThat(restartStrategy.canRestart()).isFalse();
}
```
   
**Explanation of the refactoring:**

1. **Identify the repeated expression:** The expression `new ManualClock()` was encountered multiple times within the `testMaxAttempts()` method.

2. **Extract the variable:**
   - Declare a variable named `clock` with type `ManualClock` before the loop.
   - Assign the value `new ManualClock()` to the `clock` variable.

3. **Replace occurrences:**
   - Use the variable `clock` instead of `new ManualClock()` within the loop where time advancement is needed.

**Benefits of this refactoring:**

- **Readability:** The code becomes more readable as the intent of using a `ManualClock` object is clearer with a descriptive variable name.
- **Maintainability:** If changes are needed to the construction of the `ManualClock` object, it can be done in one place, affecting all uses of the clock.
- **Reusability:** Other parts of the code could potentially reuse the `clock` variable, if needed, preventing further repetitions.
