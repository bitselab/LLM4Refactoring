 **Here's the refactored code with the extracted variable:**

```java
private Builder(LuceneSearchIndexScope<?> scope, LuceneSearchIndexValueFieldContext<F> field) {
    super(scope, field);

    LuceneFieldCodec<F> codec = field.type().codec();
    LuceneVectorFieldCodec<F> vectorCodec = (LuceneVectorFieldCodec<F>) codec;

    if (vectorCodec != null) {
        vectorElementsType = vectorCodec.vectorElementsType();
        indexedVectorsDimension = vectorCodec.getConfiguredDimensions();
    } else {
        // shouldn't really happen as if someone tries this it should fail on `queryElementFactory` lookup.
        throw new AssertionFailure("Attempting to use a knn predicate on a non-vector field.");
    }
}
```

**Explanation of the Refactoring:**

1. **Identified the Repeated Expression:** The expression `(LuceneVectorFieldCodec<F>) codec` was used twice within the method, making it a good candidate for extraction.
2. **Extracted the Variable:** The expression was extracted into a new variable named `vectorCodec` of type `LuceneVectorFieldCodec<F>`, placed before the conditional statement.
3. **Replaced the Expression:** The original occurrences of the expression were replaced with the newly created variable.

**Benefits of This Refactoring:**

- **Improved Readability:** The code becomes more readable by removing redundancy and giving a descriptive name to the extracted value.
- **Enhanced Maintainability:** The code becomes easier to understand and modify, as changes to the codec interaction can be made in one place.
- **Potential for Reuse:** If the `vectorCodec` is needed elsewhere in the method, it's now readily available.
