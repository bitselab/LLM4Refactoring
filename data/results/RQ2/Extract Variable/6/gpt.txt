In the provided code snippet, the method `getFileSystem` contains multiple calls to `getAbfsStore(fs)` which can be refactored using the "Extract Variable" technique to improve readability and efficiency. By extracting this repetitive call into a single variable, the code becomes cleaner and easier to maintain. Here's the refactored version of the `getFileSystem` method:

```java
private AzureBlobFileSystem getFileSystem(final boolean optimizeFooterRead,
                                          final int fileSize) throws IOException {
    final AzureBlobFileSystem fs = getFileSystem();
    AzureBlobFileSystemStore store = getAbfsStore(fs); // Extracted variable

    store.getAbfsConfiguration().setOptimizeFooterRead(optimizeFooterRead);
    if (fileSize <= store.getAbfsConfiguration().getReadBufferSize()) {
        store.getAbfsConfiguration().setReadSmallFilesCompletely(false);
    }
    return fs;
}
```

In this refactored version:
- The call to `getAbfsStore(fs)` is made only once and stored in the `store` variable.
- Subsequent references to `getAbfsStore(fs)` are replaced with the `store` variable.

This change not only makes the code more readable but also potentially improves performance by reducing the number of method calls. It's a good practice to apply such refactorings across the codebase where similar patterns of repetitive method calls are observed.
