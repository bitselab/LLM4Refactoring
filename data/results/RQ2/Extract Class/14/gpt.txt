To refactor the provided code using the "Extract Class" refactoring technique, we'll create a new class that encapsulates the functionality related to byte slice management. This new class will include the static arrays `LEVEL_SIZE_ARRAY` and `NEXT_LEVEL_ARRAY`, the constant `FIRST_LEVEL_SIZE`, and the methods `newSlice`, `allocSlice`, and `allocKnownSizeSlice`. The new class will be responsible for handling all operations related to byte slices.

Let's create a new class named `ByteSliceManager` and move the relevant parts of the code into this class. We'll also need to adjust the access to `ByteBlockPool` and `pool` variables to ensure they are accessible in the context of the new class.

### Refactored Code

**ByteSliceManager.java**

```java
package org.apache.lucene.index;

import org.apache.lucene.util.ByteBlockPool;
import org.apache.lucene.util.BitUtil;

/**
 * Manages byte slices for TermsHashPerField.
 */
public class ByteSliceManager {

    public static final int[] LEVEL_SIZE_ARRAY = {5, 14, 20, 30, 40, 40, 80, 80, 120, 200};
    public static final int[] NEXT_LEVEL_ARRAY = {1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 9};
    public static final int FIRST_LEVEL_SIZE = LEVEL_SIZE_ARRAY[0];

    private final ByteBlockPool pool;

    public ByteSliceManager(ByteBlockPool pool) {
        this.pool = pool;
    }

    public int newSlice(final int size) {
        // Method implementation remains the same
    }

    public int allocSlice(final byte[] slice, final int upto) {
        // Method implementation remains the same
    }

    public int allocKnownSizeSlice(final byte[] slice, final int upto) {
        // Method implementation remains the same
    }
}
```

**TermsHashPerField.java (Partial)**

```java
package org.apache.lucene.index;

// ... [Other imports]

abstract class TermsHashPerField implements Comparable<TermsHashPerField> {

    // ... [Existing class members]

    private ByteSliceManager byteSliceManager;

    // ... [Existing constructor and methods]

    TermsHashPerField(
            // ... [Existing constructor parameters]
            ) {
        // ... [Existing constructor implementation]
        this.byteSliceManager = new ByteSliceManager(bytePool);
    }

    // ... [Other methods]

    // Remove the methods and constants that were moved to ByteSliceManager
}
```

### Explanation

1. **New Class Creation**: `ByteSliceManager` encapsulates all byte slice-related functionalities.

2. **Constructor Modification**: The `TermsHashPerField` constructor is modified to initialize `ByteSliceManager` with the `ByteBlockPool` instance.

3. **Removal of Extracted Code**: The extracted constants and methods are removed from `TermsHashPerField`.

4. **Adapting Usage**: Any usage of the extracted methods within `TermsHashPerField` should be updated to use `byteSliceManager`.

This refactoring enhances the readability and maintainability of the code by separating concerns, making `TermsHashPerField` more focused on its primary responsibilities while `ByteSliceManager` handles the specifics of byte slice management.
