 **Here's the refactored code, incorporating extract class refactorings:**

```java
package com.puppycrawl.tools.checkstyle.checks.javadoc.abstractjavadoc;

// Original class with remaining code
public class InputAbstractJavadocNonTightHtmlTags2 {
    // Remaining fields and methods...
}

// New extracted class
class ExtractedClass {
    private int field4;

    /**
     * <html> <bR> <Br> <BR> <Br/> <BR/> <bR/> </html>
     * <option> <INPut/> </option>
     *
     * @return <tbody> <input/> <br> </tbody>
     */
    int getField4() {
        return field4;
    }

    /**
     * <thead> <br> </thead>
     * <tfoot> <AREA ALT="alt" COORDS="100,0,200,50" HREF="/href/"> </tfoot>
     * <p> </p>
     *
     * @param field4 value to which {@link #field4} is to be set to
     */
    // violation 3 lines above 'tag P_TAG_START'
    void setField4(int field4) {
        this.field4 = field4;
    }

    /**
     * <p> <li> <TR> <Td> <tH> <body> <colGROUP> <DD> <dt> <Head> <HTML> <option> <tBody> <tHead>
     * <tFoot>
     *
     * @param field5 </p> value to which {@link #field5} is to be set to
     */
    // 4 violations 4 lines above
    // 'Unclosed HTML tag found: p'
    // 'tag P_START'
    // 'tag LI_START'
    // 'tag BODY_START'
    void setField5(int field5) {
        // Implement logic for field5
        // ...
    }
}
```

**Key steps involved in the refactoring:**

1. **Identify code to extract:**
   - The methods `getField4`, `setField4`, and `setField5` were logically related and could be grouped together.

2. **Create a new class:**
   - A new class named `ExtractedClass` was created to house these methods.

3. **Transfer code:**
   - The identified methods were moved from the original class to the new class.
   - The field `field4` was also moved to the new class since it's used by the extracted methods.

4. **Adjust references:**
   - Any references to the extracted methods or field within the original class were updated to now access them through the `ExtractedClass` instance.

**Benefits of extract class refactoring:**

- **Improved readability:** Classes become more focused and easier to understand.
- **Enhanced maintainability:** Changes can be made to a specific set of functionality within its own class.
- **Reduced complexity:** Breaking down a large class into smaller, more manageable classes simplifies the code.
- **Improved cohesion:** Each class has a clear responsibility and encapsulates related functionality.
- **Potential for reuse:** Extracted classes can often be reused in other parts of the code.
