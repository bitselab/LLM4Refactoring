To refactor the provided code snippet, we'll focus on the `mockWriterMetricGroup` methods. These methods are primarily for testing purposes and do not necessarily belong in the main `InternalSinkWriterMetricGroup` class. Extracting these methods into a separate class can improve the readability and maintainability of the code.

### Refactoring Steps:
1. **Create a new class** (e.g., `InternalSinkWriterMetricGroupFactory`) that will be responsible for creating instances of `InternalSinkWriterMetricGroup`, especially for testing purposes.
2. **Move the `mockWriterMetricGroup` methods** to this new class.
3. **Adjust the visibility and static nature** of the methods if necessary, based on the new class's context.

### Refactored Code

#### New Factory Class for `InternalSinkWriterMetricGroup`

```java
package org.apache.flink.runtime.metrics.groups;

import org.apache.flink.annotation.VisibleForTesting;
import org.apache.flink.metrics.MetricGroup;
import org.apache.flink.metrics.groups.OperatorIOMetricGroup;

/**
 * Factory class for creating instances of InternalSinkWriterMetricGroup, primarily for testing.
 */
public class InternalSinkWriterMetricGroupFactory {

    @VisibleForTesting
    public static InternalSinkWriterMetricGroup mockWriterMetricGroup(MetricGroup metricGroup) {
        return new InternalSinkWriterMetricGroup(
                metricGroup, UnregisteredMetricsGroup.createOperatorIOMetricGroup());
    }

    @VisibleForTesting
    public static InternalSinkWriterMetricGroup mockWriterMetricGroup(
            MetricGroup metricGroup, OperatorIOMetricGroup operatorIOMetricGroup) {
        return new InternalSinkWriterMetricGroup(metricGroup, operatorIOMetricGroup);
    }
}
```

#### Updated `InternalSinkWriterMetricGroup` Class

```java
package org.apache.flink.runtime.metrics.groups;

// ... [Other Imports] ...

@Internal
public class InternalSinkWriterMetricGroup extends ProxyMetricGroup<MetricGroup>
        implements SinkWriterMetricGroup {

    // ... [Field Declarations] ...

    // Constructor and other methods remain unchanged

    // Removed the mockWriterMetricGroup methods

    // ... [Other Methods] ...
}
```

### Summary of Changes
- Extracted the `mockWriterMetricGroup` methods into a new class `InternalSinkWriterMetricGroupFactory`. This class is now responsible for creating instances of `InternalSinkWriterMetricGroup` for testing purposes.
- Removed the `mockWriterMetricGroup` methods from the original `InternalSinkWriterMetricGroup` class to clean up its responsibilities and focus on its primary role.

This refactoring enhances the single responsibility principle and makes the codebase more organized and testable.
