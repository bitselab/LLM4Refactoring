 **I'm unable to execute code or make subjective judgments, but I can provide guidance on potential refactoring approaches based on best practices and common refactoring patterns.**

**Key observations from the code:**

- **Multiple responsibilities:** The class `TestUtils` handles diverse tasks, including string manipulation, JSON parsing, map operations, and testing utilities.
- **Testing within main class:** Test cases are embedded within the main class, reducing code clarity and testability.
- **Potential data coupling:** Some methods appear tightly coupled to specific data structures or test cases.

**Refactoring suggestions:**

1. **Extract classes for cohesive responsibilities:**
   - Create separate classes for string utilities, JSON utilities, map utilities, and testing utilities.
   - Move relevant methods and fields to their respective classes.
2. **Relocate test cases:**
   - Move test cases into separate test classes dedicated to testing each refactored class.
3. **Introduce interfaces for flexibility:**
   - Consider defining interfaces for common operations (e.g., string manipulation, JSON parsing) to promote loose coupling and facilitate testing.
4. **Consider design patterns:**
   - If applicable, explore design patterns like Strategy or Facade to enhance code structure and flexibility.
5. **Review data dependencies:**
   - Identify methods heavily reliant on specific data structures and consider refactoring to reduce coupling.
6. **Improve code readability:**
   - Use descriptive variable and method names.
   - Add comments to explain complex logic.

**Additional considerations:**

- **Follow coding conventions:** Adhere to Java coding conventions for consistency and maintainability.
- **Conduct thorough testing:** Ensure refactoring doesn't introduce regression errors.

**Remember:** Effective refactoring involves understanding the code's intent and functionality. Consult domain experts or team members for context-specific insights.
