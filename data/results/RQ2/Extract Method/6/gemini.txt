 **Here's a breakdown of the code's functionality, key areas for refactoring, and suggested steps:**

**Code Functionality:**

- **Tests `AbfsInputStream`'s behavior with varying file sizes and footer read buffer sizes.**
- **Focuses on optimizing footer reads to reduce server calls.**
- **Verifies configuration settings for footer read buffer size.**

**Key Areas for Refactoring:**

- **Extract methods for repetitive logic (e.g., file creation, content verification).**
- **Combine similar test cases with data-driven approaches.**
- **Simplify conditional logic for readability.**
- **Consider using a mocking framework for easier testing.**

**Suggested Refactoring Steps:**

1. **Extract Redundant Logic:**
   - Create methods for `createFileWithContent`, `assertContentReadCorrectly`, etc.
2. **Combine Similar Test Cases:**
   - Use parameterized tests for cases with varying file sizes and buffer sizes.
3. **Simplify Conditional Logic:**
   - Refactor conditions for improved readability and maintainability.
4. **Introduce a Mocking Framework:**
   - Isolate unit tests and control dependencies effectively.
5. **Consider Additional Improvements:**
   - Refactor `seek` method for clarity.
   - Improve test organization and naming conventions.

**Specific Refactoring Examples:**

- **Extract Method:**
   ```java
   private Path createFileWithContent(AzureBlobFileSystem fs, String fileName, byte[] content) {
       // ... file creation logic ...
   }
   ```

- **Parameterized Test:**
   ```java
   @ParameterizedTest
   @CsvSource({"256, 256", "512, 512", "1024, 1024"})
   void testSeekAndReadWithConf(int fileSize, int footerReadBufferSize) throws Exception {
       // ... test logic using fileSize and footerReadBufferSize ...
   }
   ```

- **Mocking Framework:**
   ```java
   AbfsInputStream abfsInputStream = Mockito.spy(new AbfsInputStream(...));
   Mockito.doReturn(...).when(abfsInputStream).readRemote(...);
   ```
