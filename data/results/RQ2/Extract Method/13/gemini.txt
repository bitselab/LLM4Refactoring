 **I'm ready to tackle the refactoring task! However, I'll need more guidance on the specific changes you'd like to make.**

**Here's a breakdown of the code's key elements to help you articulate your goals:**

**Purpose:**
- Tests the `@AutoClose` extension in JUnit Jupiter, which automatically calls `close()` on certain fields after tests.

**Structure:**
- `AutoCloseTests` class: Main test class with various test cases.
- `AutoCloseSpy` class: Simulates a closable resource for testing.

**Test cases:**
- Cover @AutoClose usage for different field types, test instance lifecycles, nested classes, test class hierarchies, and exception handling.

**Please provide details on:**

- **Specific refactoring goals:**
    - Refactor to improve code structure?
    - Refactor to enhance readability?
    - Refactor to optimize performance?
    - Refactor to incorporate a design pattern?
    - Address potential issues identified in a code review?
- **Which parts of the code to focus on:**
    - Refactor only specific test cases?
    - Refactor the entire `AutoCloseTests` class?
    - Refactor the `AutoCloseSpy` class?
- **Desired changes or patterns:**
    - Extract methods for better organization?
    - Introduce interfaces for test subjects?
    - Rearrange test execution order?
    - Refactor to align with best practices?
    - Address any code smells or anti-patterns?

**Once I have a clearer understanding of your objectives, I'll provide tailored refactoring recommendations and can even generate code snippets to illustrate potential changes.**
