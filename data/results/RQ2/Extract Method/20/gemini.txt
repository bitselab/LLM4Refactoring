Absolutely! Here's the refactored code of `BridgeMethodResolver` with the extracted method:

```java
public final class BridgeMethodResolver {

  private static final Map<Object, Method> cache = new ConcurrentReferenceHashMap<>();

  private BridgeMethodResolver() {}

  public static Method findBridgedMethod(Method bridgeMethod) {
    Class<?> targetClass = bridgeMethod.getDeclaringClass();
    return findBridgedMethod(bridgeMethod, targetClass);
  }

  /**
   * Finds the bridged method for the given bridge method considering the target class.
   * 
   * @param bridgeMethod the bridge method to find the original for
   * @param targetClass the target class to search for the bridged method
   * @return the original method (either the bridged method or the passed-in method
   *         if no more specific one could be found)
   */
  private static Method findBridgedMethod(Method bridgeMethod, Class<?> targetClass) {
    boolean localBridge = (targetClass == bridgeMethod.getDeclaringClass());
    if (!bridgeMethod.isBridge() && localBridge) {
      return bridgeMethod;
    }

    Object cacheKey = (localBridge ? bridgeMethod : new MethodClassKey(bridgeMethod, targetClass));
    Method bridgedMethod = cache.get(cacheKey);
    if (bridgedMethod == null) {
      // Logic to find the bridged method remains the same
      // ...

      if (bridgedMethod == null) {
        // A bridge method was passed in but we couldn't find the bridged method.
        // Let's proceed with the passed-in method and hope for the best...
        bridgedMethod = bridgeMethod;
      }
      cache.put(cacheKey, bridgedMethod);
    }
    return bridgedMethod;
  }

  // Other methods from the original class...
}
```

The original logic to find the bridged method is now encapsulated within the new private method `findBridgedMethod(Method bridgeMethod, Class<?> targetClass)`. This improves code readability and maintainability by separating the logic for handling local bridges and searching for the actual bridged method.
