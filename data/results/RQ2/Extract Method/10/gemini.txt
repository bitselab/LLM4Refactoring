 **Here's the refactored code with the extracted method:**

```java
package org.springframework.boot.loader.zip;

// ... other imports

// ... other code

class ManagedFileChannel {

    // ... other code

    int read(ByteBuffer dst, long position) throws IOException {
        synchronized (this.lock) {
            if (position < this.bufferPosition || position >= this.bufferPosition + this.bufferSize) {
                readWithRetry(position);
            }
            if (this.bufferSize <= 0) {
                return this.bufferSize;
            }
            int offset = (int) (position - this.bufferPosition);
            int length = Math.min(this.bufferSize - offset, dst.remaining());
            dst.put(dst.position(), this.buffer, offset, length);
            dst.position(dst.position() + length);
            return length;
        }
    }

    private void readWithRetry(long position) throws IOException {
        for (int i = 0; i < 10; i++) {
            boolean interrupted = (i != 0) ? Thread.interrupted() : false;
            try {
                this.buffer.clear();
                this.bufferSize = this.fileChannel.read(this.buffer, position);
                this.bufferPosition = position;
                return;
            } catch (ClosedByInterruptException ex) {
                repairFileChannel();
            } finally {
                if (interrupted) {
                    Thread.currentThread().interrupt();
                }
            }
        }
        throw new ClosedByInterruptException();
    }

    // ... other code
}
```

**Key aspects of the refactoring:**

- **Extracted method:** The code responsible for reading from the file channel with retry logic has been extracted into a separate method named `readWithRetry`.
- **Encapsulation:** The encapsulated code handles potential `ClosedByInterruptException` and repairs the file channel if necessary, improving readability and maintainability.
- **Readability:** The `read` method now focuses on its core logic, delegating the retry handling to the `readWithRetry` method, making it easier to understand.

**Additional considerations for refactoring:**

- **Meaningful name:** The extracted method name `readWithRetry` clearly conveys its purpose, aiding comprehension.
- **Comments:** Adding comments to explain the rationale behind the refactoring and the purpose of the extracted method can further improve clarity.
- **Other refactoring opportunities:** Depending on the context and specific goals, you might consider additional refactoring techniques to enhance code structure and maintainability.
