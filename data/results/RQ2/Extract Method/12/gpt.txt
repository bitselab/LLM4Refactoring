The code snippet provided from the `FileBasedConfig` class in the `load` method contains a complex logic block that is a good candidate for the "Extract Method" refactoring. This refactoring aims to improve readability and maintainability by breaking down complex methods into simpler, smaller methods, each with a clear purpose.

Here's how the refactoring can be applied:

1. **Extracting the File Loading Logic**: The block of code that processes the file can be extracted into a separate method, say `processFile`.

2. **Handling the Return Value**: The original code block returns `Boolean.TRUE`. This should be handled appropriately in the refactored method.

Here is the refactored version of the `load` method with the extract method refactoring applied:

```java
@Override
public void load() throws IOException, ConfigInvalidException {
    lock.readLock().lock();
    try {
        Boolean wasRead = FileUtils.readWithRetries(getFile(), this::processFile);
        if (wasRead == null) {
            clear();
            snapshot = FileSnapshot.MISSING_FILE;
        }
        exists.set(wasRead != null);
    } catch (IOException e) {
        throw e;
    } catch (Exception e) {
        throw new ConfigInvalidException(MessageFormat
                .format(JGitText.get().cannotReadFile, getFile()), e);
    } finally {
        lock.readLock().unlock();
    }
}

private Boolean processFile(File f) throws IOException {
    FileSnapshot oldSnapshot = snapshot;
    FileSnapshot newSnapshot = FileSnapshot.saveNoConfig(f);
    byte[] in = IO.readFully(f);
    ObjectId newHash = hash(in);
    if (hash.equals(newHash)) {
        if (oldSnapshot.equals(newSnapshot)) {
            oldSnapshot.setClean(newSnapshot);
        } else {
            snapshot = newSnapshot;
        }
    } else {
        String decoded;
        if (isUtf8(in)) {
            decoded = RawParseUtils.decode(UTF_8, in, 3, in.length);
            utf8Bom = true;
        } else {
            decoded = RawParseUtils.decode(in);
        }
        fromText(decoded);
        snapshot = newSnapshot;
        hash = newHash;
    }
    return Boolean.TRUE;
}
```

In this refactoring:

- The logic for processing the file is encapsulated in `processFile`.
- `processFile` is passed as a method reference to `FileUtils.readWithRetries`.
- The handling of `wasRead == null` and setting the `exists` atomic boolean is still part of the `load` method, maintaining the separation of concerns.

This refactoring makes the code more readable and maintainable, as the `processFile` method now encapsulates a specific task within the file loading process. As always, it's important to test the refactored code to ensure that it behaves as expected.
