 **Here's the refactored code with the extracted method:**

```java
package org.eclipse.jgit.storage.file;

// ... other imports

public class FileBasedConfig extends StoredConfig {

  // ... other code

  @Override
  public void load() throws IOException, ConfigInvalidException {
    lock.readLock().lock();
    try {
      Boolean wasRead = FileUtils.readWithRetries(getFile(), this::processFileContent);
      // ... rest of the load() method
  }

  private boolean processFileContent(File f) throws IOException, ConfigInvalidException {
    FileSnapshot oldSnapshot = snapshot;
    FileSnapshot newSnapshot = FileSnapshot.saveNoConfig(f);
    byte[] in = IO.readFully(f);
    ObjectId newHash = hash(in);
    if (hash.equals(newHash)) {
      if (oldSnapshot.equals(newSnapshot)) {
        oldSnapshot.setClean(newSnapshot);
      } else {
        snapshot = newSnapshot;
      }
    } else {
      String decoded;
      if (isUtf8(in)) {
        decoded = RawParseUtils.decode(UTF_8, in, 3, in.length);
        utf8Bom = true;
      } else {
        decoded = RawParseUtils.decode(in);
      }
      fromText(decoded);
      snapshot = newSnapshot;
      hash = newHash;
    }
    return Boolean.TRUE;
  }

  // ... other code
}
```

**Explanation of the changes:**

1. **Extracted method:** The code block identified for extraction has been moved into a new private method named `processFileContent`.
2. **Method placement:** The extracted method is placed within the `FileBasedConfig` class to maintain its context and access to class members.
3. **Invocation:** The `processFileContent` method is called within the `load` method using a method reference (`this::processFileContent`), passing the file as an argument.
4. **Return value:** The extracted method returns `Boolean.TRUE` to maintain consistency with the original code's behavior within `FileUtils.readWithRetries`.

**Benefits of this refactoring:**

- **Improved readability:** The `load` method is now more concise and easier to read, as the logic for processing file content is separated into a dedicated method.
- **Better organization:** The code is more modular, with a clear separation of concerns between loading the configuration and processing file content.
- **Enhanced maintainability:** The extracted method can be tested and modified independently, making it easier to maintain and update the code in the future.
