 **Here's the refactored code with the extracted method:**

```java
package org.hibernate.event.internal;

// ... other imports

public class DefaultRefreshEventListener implements RefreshEventListener {

    // ... other methods

    private static Object refreshAndHandleNull(
            EventSource source,
            Object object,
            EntityPersister persister,
            LazyInitializer lazyInitializer,
            Object id,
            PersistenceContext persistenceContext
    ) {
        final Object result = source.getLoadQueryInfluencers().fromInternalFetchProfile(
                CascadingFetchProfile.REFRESH,
                () -> doRefresh(event, source, object, entry, persister, lazyInitializer, id, persistenceContext)
        );
        UnresolvableObjectException.throwIfNull(result, id, persister.getEntityName());
        return result;
    }

    private static void refresh(RefreshEvent event, RefreshContext refreshedAlready, Object object) {
        // ... other code

        evictEntity(object, persister, id, source);
        evictCachedCollections(persister, id, source);

        final Object result = refreshAndHandleNull(source, object, persister, null, id, persistenceContext);

        // ... other code
    }

    // ... other methods
}
```

**Key changes:**

1. **Extracted method:** A new method named `refreshAndHandleNull` is created to encapsulate the duplicate code snippet.
2. **Method placement:** The extracted method is placed within the `DefaultRefreshEventListener` class to maintain context and accessibility.
3. **Parameterization:** The extracted method takes necessary parameters (`source`, `object`, `persister`, `lazyInitializer`, `id`, `persistenceContext`) to handle different calling contexts.
4. **Calling the extracted method:** The duplicate code snippet is replaced with a call to the `refreshAndHandleNull` method in both instances.

**Benefits of this refactoring:**

- **Improved readability:** The code becomes more concise and easier to read by removing redundancy.
- **Enhanced reusability:** The extracted code can now be reused in other parts of the class if needed.
- **Promotes maintainability:** Changes to the logic within the duplicate code can be made in a single place, reducing the risk of errors and inconsistencies.
- **Encourages better code organization:** Extracting methods helps break down large code blocks into smaller, more manageable units.
