Absolutely! Here's the refactored code with a more descriptive parameter name:

```java
protected Tick formatTick(long timestamp) { // Renamed parameter 'now' to 'timestamp'
  long seconds = timestamp / 1000;

  // Two Ticks are cached so that for monotonically increasing times to not see any jitter from multiple cores.
  // The ticks are kept in a volatile field, so there a small risk of inconsequential multiple recalculations
  TickHolder holder = _tickHolder;
  if (holder != null) {
    if (holder.tick1 != null && holder.tick1.getSeconds() == seconds)
      return holder.tick1;
    if (holder.tick2 != null && holder.tick2.getSeconds() == seconds)
      return holder.tick2;
  }

  String prefix = doFormat(timestamp, _tzFormat1);
  String suffix = doFormat(timestamp, _tzFormat2);
  Tick tick = new Tick(seconds, prefix, suffix);
  _tickHolder = new TickHolder(tick, (holder == null) ? null : holder.tick1);
  return tick;
}
```

**Explanation:**

1. **Identified low-quality parameter name:** The parameter `now` in the method `formatTick` didn't explicitly convey its use within the function.
2. **Selected a more meaningful name:** The parameter was renamed to `timestamp` to clearly indicate that it represents a specific point in time in milliseconds since the Unix epoch.
3. **Updated code usage:** All references to the old parameter name (`now`) within the method were replaced with the new name (`timestamp`), ensuring consistency throughout the code.

**Benefits of this refactoring:**

- **Enhanced readability:** The code becomes easier to understand because the parameter's purpose is more evident.
- **Improved maintainability:** Clearer parameter names make it easier to modify and maintain the code in the future.

**Choosing the right name:**

- While `timestamp` is generally a good choice, consider if a more specific term like `currentTimeInMilliseconds` would be even clearer in the context of your application.
- Maintain consistency with naming conventions used for similar parameters in your codebase.
