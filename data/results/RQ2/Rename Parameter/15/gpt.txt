In the given code snippet, the `MapValueResolver` constructor uses the parameter name `values`, which is somewhat generic and does not fully convey the purpose or content of the parameter. A more descriptive name would improve the readability of the code. 

A suitable name could be `valueMap` or `nameValueMap`, which indicates that the parameter is a map containing name-value pairs. This name provides more context about what the map represents and how it is used in the `MapValueResolver` class.

Here's the refactored code with the renamed parameter:

```java
package org.springframework.validation;

// ... (other imports remain unchanged)

public class DataBinderConstructTests {

    // ... (rest of the class remains unchanged)

    private static class MapValueResolver implements DataBinder.ValueResolver {

        private final Map<String, Object> map;

        private MapValueResolver(Map<String, Object> nameValueMap) {
            this.map = nameValueMap;
        }

        @Override
        public Object resolveValue(String name, Class<?> type) {
            return map.get(name);
        }

        @Override
        public Set<String> getNames() {
            return this.map.keySet();
        }
    }

    // ... (rest of the classes remain unchanged)
}
```

This small change enhances the readability and clarity of the code, making it easier to understand the role of the `MapValueResolver` constructor's parameter.
