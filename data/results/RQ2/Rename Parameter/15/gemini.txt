You're absolutely right. The parameter name "values" in the `MapValueResolver` class is not very descriptive. Here's how we can refactor the code to improve readability:

**Original Code:**

```java
private static class MapValueResolver implements DataBinder.ValueResolver {

  private final Map<String, Object> values;

  private MapValueResolver(Map<String, Object> values) {
    this.map = values;
  }

  // ... rest of the class
}
```

**Refactored Code:**

```java
private static class MapValueResolver implements DataBinder.ValueResolver {

  private final Map<String, Object> mappedValues;

  private MapValueResolver(Map<String, Object> mappedValues) {
    this.mappedValues = mappedValues;
  }

  // ... rest of the class
}
```

The changes made are:

1. **Renamed parameter "values" to "mappedValues":** This new name clarifies that the `Map` holds key-value pairs used for resolving values.
2. **Updated field name:** The field name is also changed to maintain consistency with the parameter name.

This refactoring improves code readability by making the purpose of the `Map` more explicit. 

**Additional Considerations:**

* You could consider using a more generic name like `data` if the `Map` can hold different types of data, not just key-value pairs. However, in this specific context, "mappedValues" seems appropriate.
* It's always a good practice to update any references to the old parameter name throughout the codebase to ensure consistency.

By following these simple steps, you can enhance code readability and maintainability for yourself and your teammates.
