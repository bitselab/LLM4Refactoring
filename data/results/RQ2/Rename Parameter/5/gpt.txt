To improve the readability of the code snippet you provided, I will focus on renaming the parameter `joinHintNeedRemove` in the `ClearOuterQueryHintShuttle` constructor. A more descriptive and concise name could be `hintToRemove`. This name clearly conveys the purpose of the parameter and aligns well with the existing naming conventions in the code.

Here's how the refactored code will look:

```java
package org.apache.flink.table.planner.hint;

// ... [Other import statements remain the same]

public class ClearQueryHintsWithInvalidPropagationShuttle extends QueryHintsRelShuttle {

    // ... [Rest of the ClearQueryHintsWithInvalidPropagationShuttle class remains the same]

    /**
     * A shuttle to clean the query hints which are in outer query block and should not affect the
     * query-block inside.
     *
     * <p>Only the nodes that query hints could attach may be cleared. See more at {@link
     * FlinkHintStrategies}.
     */
    private static class ClearOuterQueryHintShuttle extends RelShuttleImpl {
        private final Deque<Integer> currentInheritPath;
        private final RelHint hintToRemove;

        public ClearOuterQueryHintShuttle(RelHint hintToRemove) {
            this.hintToRemove = hintToRemove;
            this.currentInheritPath = new ArrayDeque<>();
            this.currentInheritPath.addAll(hintToRemove.inheritPath);
        }

        // ... [Rest of the ClearOuterQueryHintShuttle class remains the same]

        // The rest of the methods remain unchanged
    }
}
```

In this refactored version:
- The parameter `joinHintNeedRemove` in the `ClearOuterQueryHintShuttle` constructor is renamed to `hintToRemove`.
- The rest of the code remains unchanged.

This renaming makes the purpose of the parameter clearer, enhancing the overall readability and maintainability of the code.
