Absolutely! You're right, the parameter  `collection` in the `withDefaultCollection` method can be improved for better readability. Here's the refactored code with the renamed parameter:

```java
public Builder withDefaultCollectionName(String defaultCollectionName) {
  this.defaultCollection = defaultCollectionName;
  return this;
}
```

**Explanation of the change:**

- The parameter name is changed from `collection` to `defaultCollectionName`.
- This new name explicitly conveys the purpose of the parameter, which is to set the default collection name for requests.

**Benefits of this refactoring:**

- **Enhanced Readability:** The code becomes easier to understand for both the original developer and anyone working on the code in the future. 
- **Improved Maintainability:** Clearer parameter names make the code less prone to errors and easier to modify.

This refactoring adheres to common naming conventions, making the code more consistent and predictable for programmers familiar with similar codebases.
