To improve the readability of the code, it's a good practice to use meaningful parameter names that clearly describe the purpose or nature of the parameter. In the given code snippet, the parameter named `ignore` in the method `getReader` is not descriptive of its role or function. A more appropriate name would be `charset`, as it denotes the character encoding to be used. Here's the refactored version of the method with the renamed parameter:

```java
public Reader getReader(final Charset charset) throws IOException {
    return new CharSequenceReader(get());
}
```

In this refactored method, I've renamed the parameter from `ignore` to `charset`. This change makes it clearer that the method expects a `Charset` object, even though in this specific implementation, the charset is not used (hence the original name `ignore`). However, using a standard and descriptive name like `charset` is better for code readability and maintainability, especially if the method's implementation might change in the future or if other developers are reading the code.
