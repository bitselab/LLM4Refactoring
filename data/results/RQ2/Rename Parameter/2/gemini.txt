 **I'm ready to assist with refactoring the code, but I'll need specific guidance on how you want to rename the parameters.**

**Here's a framework to approach this task effectively:**

1. **Identify Parameters to Rename:**
   - Carefully examine the code and pinpoint the exact parameters you want to modify.
   - Consider their purpose and usage within the code.

2. **Choose Clear and Meaningful New Names:**
   - Select names that accurately reflect the parameter's role and enhance code readability.
   - Adhere to existing coding conventions and naming styles for consistency.

3. **Plan for Impact:**
   - Assess how renaming a parameter might affect other parts of the code.
   - Identify all references to the parameter and plan to update them accordingly.

4. **Use Refactoring Tools (if available):**
   - Many IDEs and code editors offer refactoring tools to automate parameter renaming.
   - These tools can reduce manual effort and errors.

**Once you provide the specific parameter names and their desired new names, I can offer tailored advice on:**

- **Effective renaming strategies within the code's context.**
- **Potential implications and necessary adjustments in other areas.**
- **Best practices for refactoring and maintaining code readability.**

**Additional Information:**

- **Refactoring Goals:** Understanding the purpose of the refactoring can help ensure the chosen parameter names align with the overall objectives.
- **Constraints or Considerations:** Share any specific requirements or concerns you have for the refactoring process.

**I'm committed to providing comprehensive guidance throughout the refactoring process. Please provide the necessary details, and I'll be ready to assist further.**
