 **Here's the refactored code with a more descriptive parameter name:**

```java
public class XmlPrinterTest {

    // ... other code ...

    public void assertXMLEquals(String expectedXml, String actualXml) throws SAXException, IOException { // Renamed parameter
        final Document expectedDocument = getDocument(expectedXml); // Updated usage
        final Document actualDocument = getDocument(actualXml);

        // ... rest of the code ...
    }

    // ... other code ...
}
```

**Explanation:**

1. **Identified the low-quality parameter name:** The parameter `xml1` in the method `assertXMLEquals` was not very descriptive of its purpose.
2. **Selected a more meaningful name:** The parameter was renamed to `expectedXml` to clearly convey that it holds the expected XML string for comparison.
3. **Updated code usage:** All references to the old parameter name within the method were replaced with the new name, ensuring consistency.

**Benefits of this refactoring:**

- **Improved readability:** The code becomes easier to understand for both you and other developers because the parameter's role is more evident.
- **Enhanced maintainability:** Clearer parameter names make it easier to modify and maintain the code in the future.
- **Potential for better code analysis:** Some IDEs and code analysis tools can better understand and offer suggestions when parameters have meaningful names.

**Additional tips for effective parameter renaming:**

- Choose names that accurately reflect the parameter's purpose and data type.
- Consider using consistent naming conventions across your codebase.
- If a change is extensive, update any relevant documentation or comments.
- Use your IDE's refactoring tools to automate the renaming process and ensure all references are updated correctly.
