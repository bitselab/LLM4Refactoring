The parameter name `declaringClass` in the method `isBridgeMethodFor` could be improved for clarity. The current name, while not entirely unclear, might be more precisely named to reflect its role in the method. A suitable alternative would be `targetClass` or `candidateClass`, as it represents the class in which the method is being searched for or compared against. This change would enhance the readability and understanding of the code, making it clearer what role this parameter plays in the context of the method.

### Refactored Method with Renamed Parameter

#### Original `isBridgeMethodFor` Method:

```java
static boolean isBridgeMethodFor(Method bridgeMethod, Method candidateMethod, Class<?> declaringClass) {
    if (isResolvedTypeMatch(candidateMethod, bridgeMethod, declaringClass)) {
        return true;
    }
    Method method = findGenericDeclaration(bridgeMethod);
    return (method != null && isResolvedTypeMatch(method, candidateMethod, declaringClass));
}
```

#### Refactored `isBridgeMethodFor` Method:

```java
static boolean isBridgeMethodFor(Method bridgeMethod, Method candidateMethod, Class<?> targetClass) {
    if (isResolvedTypeMatch(candidateMethod, bridgeMethod, targetClass)) {
        return true;
    }
    Method method = findGenericDeclaration(bridgeMethod);
    return (method != null && isResolvedTypeMatch(method, candidateMethod, targetClass));
}
```

- **Refactoring Explanation**: Renamed the parameter `declaringClass` to `targetClass`. This new name better indicates that this class is the one in which we are attempting to find a match for the bridge method, making the code more intuitive and easier to understand.

This refactoring focuses on improving the semantic clarity of the code, which can aid in better understanding and maintenance of the codebase.
