Certainly! The parameter name "declaringClass" in the method `isBridgeMethodFor` can be improved for better readability. Here's the refactored code snippet:

```java
static boolean isBridgeMethodFor(Method bridgeMethod, Method candidateMethod, Class<?> targetType) {
  if (isResolvedTypeMatch(candidateMethod, bridgeMethod, targetType)) {
    return true;
  }
  Method method = findGenericDeclaration(bridgeMethod);
  return (method != null && isResolvedTypeMatch(method, candidateMethod, targetType));
}
```

**Explanation of the change:**

* The parameter name "declaringClass" is changed to "targetType".
* This new name better reflects the purpose of the parameter, which is to hold the class against which the types are being resolved.

**Benefits of this refactoring:**

* **Enhanced Readability:** The code becomes easier to understand for developers working on the codebase.
* **Improved Maintainability:** Clearer parameter names make the code less error-prone and easier to modify in the future.

"targetType" is a more specific term compared to "declaringClass" as it clarifies that the class is used for type resolution within the context of the bridge method and candidate method. This improves code clarity and maintainability.
