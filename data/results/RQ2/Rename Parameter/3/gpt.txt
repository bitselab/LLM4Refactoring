The parameter name `excludeFieldNamesParam` in the method `setExcludeFieldNames` can indeed be improved for better readability. A more appropriate name would be simply `excludeFieldNames`, which is concise and clearly describes its purpose. This change aligns the parameter name with the common naming conventions in Java, making the code more readable and maintainable.

Here's the refactored method:

```java
public Builder<T> setExcludeFieldNames(final String... excludeFieldNames) {
    this.excludeFieldNames = toExcludeFieldNames(excludeFieldNames);
    return this;
}
```

This refactoring improves the readability of the method by using a parameter name that clearly and concisely describes what the parameter represents, which in this case are field names to be excluded.
