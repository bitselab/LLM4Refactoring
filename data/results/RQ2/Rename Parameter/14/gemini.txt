 **I'm unable to execute code or make functional changes, but I can provide a comprehensive overview of the code snippet and suggest potential refactoring approaches:**

**Purpose of the Code:**

- **Extracts terms and their positions from queries for highlighting purposes.**
- **Works with various query types (BooleanQuery, PhraseQuery, SpanQuery, etc.).**
- **Handles multi-term queries like wildcards and fuzzy searches.**
- **Utilizes a MemoryIndex for inverting token streams efficiently.**

**Key Components:**

1. **WeightedSpanTermExtractor:** Main class responsible for extracting terms and positions.
2. **extract() methods:** Core logic for visiting different query types and extracting terms.
3. **getLeafContext():** Creates a LeafReader for accessing field data and term positions.
4. **DelegatingLeafReader:** Wraps a LeafReader to ensure a consistent field name for retrieval.

**Refactoring Suggestions:**

- **Break down extract() methods into smaller, more focused functions for better readability.**
- **Create a hierarchy of query handling classes for improved organization and extensibility.**
- **Consider strategy pattern for query-specific extraction logic.**
- **Explore alternative approaches to MemoryIndex for performance optimization.**
- **Add more descriptive comments and Javadoc for better code clarity.**
- **Adhere to consistent formatting and naming conventions.**

**Additional Context for Refactoring:**

- **Specific refactoring goals (e.g., readability, maintainability, performance).**
- **Constraints or limitations for refactoring.**
- **Testing strategies to ensure code quality after refactoring.**

I'm ready to provide more specific guidance once you share additional details about your refactoring objectives and constraints.
