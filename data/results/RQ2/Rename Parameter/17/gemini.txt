 **Here's the refactored code with a more descriptive parameter name:**

```java
public class ExhaustiveSwitch {

    // ... other code

    static int coverage(Object inputObject) {  // Renamed parameter to "inputObject"
        return switch (inputObject) {
            case String s -> s.length();
            case Integer i -> i;
            default -> 0;
        };
    }

    // ... other code
}
```

**Explanation of the change:**

- The parameter `o` in the `coverage` method has been renamed to `inputObject`. This name better conveys the purpose of the parameter, which is to receive an object for processing.
- The new name is more specific and aligns with the general coding convention of using descriptive variable and parameter names.

**Additional Considerations:**

- **Consistency:** Make sure to update any references to the old parameter name (`o`) within the `coverage` method or other related code to maintain consistency.
- **Broader Refactoring:** Consider exploring other refactoring opportunities in the code to further enhance readability and maintainability. For example:
    - Rename other variables or methods with unclear names.
    - Introduce helper methods to break down complex logic.
    - Improve code formatting and spacing for better visual clarity.

**Key Takeaways:**

- Renaming parameters is a valuable refactoring technique for improving code clarity.
- Choose descriptive names that accurately reflect the parameter's purpose.
- Consistency in naming is crucial for maintainability.
- Combine parameter renaming with other refactoring techniques for optimal code quality.
