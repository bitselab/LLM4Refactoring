## Refactoring the `mutationTarget` Parameter

You're absolutely right! The parameter `mutationTarget` in the `createStatementDetailsMap` method could benefit from a more descriptive name. Here's how to refactor it:

**1. Analyze Parameter Usage:**

- This parameter is used within the method to potentially provide a `GeneratedValuesMutationDelegate` object.
- It's used when creating `PreparedStatementDetails` for tables related to identifier generation.

**2. Choose a Descriptive Name:**

Here are some options that better reflect the parameter's purpose:

- `generatedValuesDelegate`: This explicitly states its role in handling generated values.
- `idGenDelegate`: This is a shorter and more specific option for identifier generation.

**3. Refactoring:**

Use your IDE's refactoring tools to safely rename the parameter throughout the method:

```java
private static SortedMap<String, PreparedStatementDetails> createStatementDetailsMap(
  List<PreparableMutationOperation> jdbcMutations,
  MutationType mutationType,
  GeneratedValuesMutationDelegate generatedValuesDelegate, // Renamed parameter
  SharedSessionContractImplementor session) {
  // ... rest of the method
}
```

**4. Testing:**

- Recompile the code to ensure no errors arise.
- Execute thorough unit tests to verify all functionalities remain intact.

**Choosing the Best Name:**

- If identifier generation is a common scenario, `idGenDelegate` might be preferable.
- If the purpose is broader and may involve other types of generated values, `generatedValuesDelegate` offers more clarity.

**Additional Considerations:**

- Maintain consistency with existing naming conventions in the codebase.
- Ensure the new name aligns with the broader context of the method.

By following these steps, you can improve the readability and maintainability of the code.
