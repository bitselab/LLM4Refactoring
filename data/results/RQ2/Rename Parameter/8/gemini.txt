## Refactoring the `enableSkipping` Parameter

You're correct! The parameter `enableSkipping` in the constructor of `DoubleValuesSourceComparator` could be renamed for better clarity. Here's how to refactor it:

**1. Analyze Parameter Usage:**

- This parameter is a `Pruning` enum value.
- It controls whether Lucene performs optimizations like skipping irrelevant documents during searching.

**2. Choose a Descriptive Name:**

Here are some options that better reflect the parameter's purpose:

- `useSkipping`: This clearly indicates whether skipping is enabled.
- `allowPruning`: This emphasizes potential performance optimizations.

**3. Refactoring:**

Use your IDE's refactoring tools to safely rename the parameter throughout the constructor:

```java
public DoubleValuesSourceComparator(int numHits, String field, Double missingValue, boolean reversed,
                                     Pruning useSkipping, // Renamed parameter
                                     DoubleMultiValuesToSingleValuesSource source) {
  super(numHits, field, missingValue, reversed, useSkipping);
  this.source = source;
}
```

**4. Testing:**

- Recompile the code to ensure no errors arise.
- Execute unit tests to verify all functionalities remain intact.

**Choosing the Best Name:**

- If clarity is the primary concern, `useSkipping` might be more readable.
- If the focus is on performance optimization, `allowPruning` could be suitable.

**Additional Considerations:**

- Maintain consistency with existing naming conventions in the Lucene library.
- Ensure the new name aligns with the broader context of search optimization.

By following these steps, you can improve the code's readability and maintainability for developers familiar with Lucene concepts.
