Here's the refactored code with the `createNonCustomizedTextField` method inlined:

```java
public class NewItemSimplePopupPanel extends JBPanel implements Disposable {
  // ... other code ...

  protected ExtendableTextField createTextField(boolean liveErrorValidation) {
    ExtendableTextField res = new ExtendableTextField(); // Inline createNonCustomizedTextField

    Dimension minSize = res.getMinimumSize();
    Dimension prefSize = res.getPreferredSize();
    minSize.height = JBUIScale.scale(28);
    prefSize.height = JBUIScale.scale(28);
    res.setMinimumSize(minSize);
    res.setPreferredSize(prefSize);
    res.setColumns(30);

    // ... rest of the method logic ...

    return res;
  }

  // ... other code ...
}
```

The `createNonCustomizedTextField` method has been removed, and its logic to create a new `ExtendableTextField` instance has been directly integrated into the `createTextField` method.

**Benefits of inlining:**

- **Improved readability:** The code becomes more concise and easier to follow by eliminating the extra method call.
- **Reduced code size:**  There's one less method to maintain.
- **Potentially improved performance:** While usually minimal, removing a method call can slightly improve performance.

**Things to consider:**

- If the logic within `createNonCustomizedTextField` becomes more complex in the future, it might be beneficial to keep it as a separate method for better maintainability.
