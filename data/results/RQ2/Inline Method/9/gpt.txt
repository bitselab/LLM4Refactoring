To refactor the code and inline the `createNonCustomizedTextField` method, we can eliminate this method and replace its usage directly with the code it contains. This method currently simply creates a new instance of `ExtendableTextField`. We can inline this by directly creating a new `ExtendableTextField` in the place where `createNonCustomizedTextField` is called.

Here's the refactored code with the `createNonCustomizedTextField` method inlined:

```java
package com.intellij.ide.ui.newItemPopup;

// import statements remain unchanged

public class NewItemSimplePopupPanel extends JBPanel implements Disposable {
    protected final ExtendableTextField myTextField;

    // Other member variables remain unchanged

    public NewItemSimplePopupPanel() {
        this(false);
    }

    public NewItemSimplePopupPanel(boolean liveValidation) {
        super(new BorderLayout());

        myTextField = createTextField(liveValidation);
        add(myTextField, BorderLayout.NORTH);

        myErrorShowPoint = new RelativePoint(myTextField, new Point(0, myTextField.getHeight()));
    }

    // Other methods remain unchanged

    protected @NotNull ExtendableTextField createTextField(boolean liveErrorValidation) {
        ExtendableTextField res = new ExtendableTextField(); // Inline the createNonCustomizedTextField method here

        // Rest of the code in createTextField remains unchanged

        return res;
    }

    // Rest of the class remains unchanged
}
```

In this refactored code, the call to `createNonCustomizedTextField` is replaced by directly instantiating `ExtendableTextField`. This simplifies the class by removing a method that added an unnecessary layer of abstraction.
