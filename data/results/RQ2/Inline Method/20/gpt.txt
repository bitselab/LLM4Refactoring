The method `restoreShutdownHook()` in the provided code is a good candidate for inline method refactoring. This method is only called once, in the `close()` method of the `AbstractApplicationContext` class. Inline refactoring involves replacing the method call with the actual method body where it's called. Since the body of `restoreShutdownHook()` is quite straightforward and its logic is not reused elsewhere, inlining this method can enhance code readability by reducing indirection.

Here is how the code looks after applying inline method refactoring to `restoreShutdownHook()`:

```java
@Override
public void close() {
    if (this.startupShutdownLock.tryLock()) {
        try {
            doClose();

            // Inline content of restoreShutdownHook() method here
            if (this.shutdownHook != null) {
                try {
                    Runtime.getRuntime().addShutdownHook(this.shutdownHook);
                }
                catch (IllegalStateException | IllegalArgumentException ex) {
                    // ignore - VM is already shutting down or hook already registered
                }
            }

        } finally {
            this.startupShutdownLock.unlock();
        }
    }
}

// Remove the restoreShutdownHook() method entirely
```

By inlining the `restoreShutdownHook()` method, the code becomes more direct and easier to follow within the context of the `close()` method. This change reduces the overall method count and keeps the related logic closer, which is beneficial for understanding and maintaining the code.
