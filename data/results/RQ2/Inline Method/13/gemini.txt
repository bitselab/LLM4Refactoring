 **Here's the refactored code with the `valueOf` method inlined:**

```java
package org.junit.jupiter.params.converter;

class StringToEnumConverter implements StringToObjectConverter {

    @Override
    public boolean canConvert(Class<?> targetType) {
        return targetType.isEnum();
    }

    @Override
    public Object convert(String source, Class<?> targetType) throws Exception {
        // Inlined content of valueOf method
        return Enum.valueOf((Class<Enum>) targetType, source);
    }
}
```

 **Explanation of the changes:**

1. The `valueOf` method has been removed entirely.
2. The call to `valueOf` within the `convert` method has been replaced with the inline expression `Enum.valueOf((Class<Enum>) targetType, source)`. This directly invokes the static `valueOf` method from the `Enum` class, eliminating the need for the helper method.
3. The cast `(Class<Enum>) targetType` has been added to ensure type safety since the `valueOf` method expects a `Class<Enum>` argument.

 **Benefits of this refactoring:**

- **Improved readability:** The code is more concise and easier to read without the extra method definition.
- **Reduced complexity:** The code is simpler and less prone to errors as there's one less method to manage.
- **Potential performance improvement:** Inlining can sometimes lead to minor performance gains by avoiding method calls.

Inline method refactoring is a valuable technique for improving code clarity and maintainability. It's often applied to short, simple methods that are used only within a single class to streamline the code and make its logic more explicit.
