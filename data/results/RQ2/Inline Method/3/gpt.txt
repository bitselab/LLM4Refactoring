To improve the readability of the code through inline method refactoring, the `validateNullToStringStyleRegistry` method can be inlined within the `after` method. Since `validateNullToStringStyleRegistry` is only called in one place and its logic is straightforward, this refactoring will simplify the structure without losing clarity. Here is the refactored code:

```java
package org.apache.commons.lang3;

import static org.junit.jupiter.api.Assertions.assertNull;

import org.apache.commons.lang3.builder.ToStringStyle;
import org.junit.jupiter.api.AfterEach;

/**
 * All tests subclass this test.
 */
public class AbstractLangTest {

    /**
     * All tests should leave the {@link ToStringStyle} registry empty.
     */
    @AfterEach
    public void after() {
        assertNull(ToStringStyle.getRegistry(), "Expected null, actual: " + ToStringStyle.getRegistry());
    }

}
```

In this refactored version, the assertion from `validateNullToStringStyleRegistry` is moved directly into the `after` method. This change reduces the number of methods in the class and makes the intention of the `after` method clearer by showing directly what it asserts.
