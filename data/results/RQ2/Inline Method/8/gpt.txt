In the provided code snippet, the `doAdd(String failureMessage)` method in the `ContextualFailureCollectorImpl` class is a good candidate for inline method refactoring. This method is relatively straightforward and only contains a conditional check followed by an action. By inlining this method, we can simplify the code and improve its readability.

Here's how the refactored code would look after applying the inline method refactoring:

### Original `ContextualFailureCollectorImpl` Class:

```java
private void doAdd(String failureMessage) {
    if (root.shouldAddFailure()) {
        failureMessages.add(failureMessage);
    }
}
```

### Refactored Usage within `ContextualFailureCollectorImpl`:

In the refactored version, I will replace the calls to `doAdd(String failureMessage)` with its body, thereby eliminating the need for the `doAdd` method.

```java
@Override
public void add(Throwable t) {
    if (t instanceof SearchException) {
        SearchException e = (SearchException) t;
        ContextualFailureCollectorImpl failureCollector = this;
        EventContext eventContext = e.context();
        if (eventContext != null) {
            failureCollector = failureCollector.withContext(e.context());
        }
        // Inline method refactoring applied here
        if (root.shouldAddFailure()) {
            failureMessages.add(e.messageWithoutContext());
        }
    } else {
        // Inline method refactoring applied here
        if (root.shouldAddFailure()) {
            failureMessages.add(t.getMessage());
        }
    }
}

@Override
public void add(String failureMessage) {
    // Inline method refactoring applied here
    if (root.shouldAddFailure()) {
        failureMessages.add(failureMessage);
    }
}
```

In this refactored version, the `doAdd` method is no longer needed, as its functionality is now directly included in the `add(Throwable t)` and `add(String failureMessage)` methods. This makes the code more straightforward and reduces the overall complexity of the `ContextualFailureCollectorImpl` class.

Remember, the goal of inline method refactoring is to make the code more readable and maintainable, especially when the method being inlined is simple and not adding significant clarity or abstraction.
