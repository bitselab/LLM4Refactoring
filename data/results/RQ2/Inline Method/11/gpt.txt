The `toString(String delim)` method in the `CommandLineBuilder` class is a clear candidate for inlining. This method is simply concatenating elements of the `args` list with a specified delimiter. We can streamline the code by removing this method and directly using `String.join` wherever `toString(String delim)` is called. This Java 8 method achieves the same result more efficiently and with less code.

### Refactored Code
```java
package org.eclipse.jetty.start;

import java.io.File;
import java.util.ArrayList;
import java.util.List;
import java.util.Objects;

public class CommandLineBuilder {
    private final StringBuilder commandLine = new StringBuilder();
    private final List<String> args = new ArrayList<>();
    private final String separator;

    public CommandLineBuilder() {
        this(false);
    }

    public CommandLineBuilder(boolean multiline) {
        separator = multiline ? (" \\" + System.lineSeparator() + "  ") : " ";
    }

    // Other methods remain unchanged

    @Override
    public String toString() {
        return String.join(" ", args); // Replaced the call to toString(String delim) with String.join
    }

    // Removed the toString(String delim) method as it's redundant now

    public String toCommandLine() {
        return commandLine.toString();
    }

    // Other methods remain unchanged
}
```

### Key Changes
1. **Removed `toString(String delim)` Method**: This method is removed as its functionality is replaced by `String.join`, which is a standard and efficient way to join strings in Java.

2. **Updated `toString()` Method**: The overridden `toString()` method now directly uses `String.join` to concatenate the arguments in `args` with spaces.

### Considerations
- Using `String.join` improves readability and efficiency.
- Always ensure that refactoring does not change the expected behavior of the code. In this case, the behavior remains the same, but the implementation is more streamlined and readable.
- It's essential to carefully evaluate the impact of inlining methods, especially in larger and more complex codebases.
