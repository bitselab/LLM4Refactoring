 **Here's the refactored code with the `toString(String delim)` method inlined:**

```java
package org.eclipse.jetty.start;

import java.io.File;
import java.util.ArrayList;
import java.util.List;
import java.util.Objects;

public class CommandLineBuilder {

  // ... other code ...

  public List<String> getArgs() {
    return args;
  }

  @Override
  public String toString() {
    // Inline the logic from toString(String delim)
    StringBuilder buf = new StringBuilder();
    for (String arg : args) {
      if (buf.length() > 0) {
        buf.append(" "); // Use a default delimiter of " "
      }
      buf.append(arg); // Assume escaping has occurred during addArg
    }

    return buf.toString();
  }

  // ... other methods ...
}
```

**Changes made:**

1. The `toString(String delim)` method has been removed.
2. Its logic for constructing the string representation using a delimiter has been integrated directly into the default `toString()` method.
3. The default delimiter is now " ", but this can be adjusted as needed within `toString()`.

**Benefits of this refactoring:**

- **Improved readability:** The code is more concise and easier to follow with one less method to consider.
- **Reduced code size:** There's one less method to maintain.
- **Simplified usage:** The default `toString()` method now provides the same functionality as the previously parameterized version, making it more convenient to use in most cases.
