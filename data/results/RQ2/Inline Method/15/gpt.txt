In the provided `BytesStore` class, the `getReverseReader` method is an ideal candidate for inline refactoring. This method is used only once, in the `getReverseBytesReader` method. Inlining this will simplify the class structure and improve readability by reducing one level of abstraction.

Refactoring involves moving the logic of `getReverseReader` directly into `getReverseBytesReader`. Here's the refactored code:

Refactored Code:
```java
package org.apache.lucene.util.fst;

// ... [Other imports]

class BytesStore extends DataOutput implements FSTReader {

    // ... [Fields and other methods]

    @Override
    public FST.BytesReader getReverseBytesReader() {
        if (blocks.size() == 1) {
            return new ReverseBytesReader(blocks.get(0));
        }
        return new FST.BytesReader() {
            private byte[] current = blocks.size() == 0 ? null : blocks.get(0);
            private int nextBuffer = -1;
            private int nextRead = 0;

            @Override
            public byte readByte() {
                if (nextRead == -1) {
                    current = blocks.get(nextBuffer--);
                    nextRead = blockSize - 1;
                }
                return current[nextRead--];
            }

            @Override
            public void skipBytes(long count) {
                setPosition(getPosition() - count);
            }

            @Override
            public void readBytes(byte[] b, int offset, int len) {
                for (int i = 0; i < len; i++) {
                    b[offset + i] = readByte();
                }
            }

            @Override
            public long getPosition() {
                return ((long) nextBuffer + 1) * blockSize + nextRead;
            }

            @Override
            public void setPosition(long pos) {
                int bufferIndex = (int) (pos >> blockBits);
                if (nextBuffer != bufferIndex - 1) {
                    nextBuffer = bufferIndex - 1;
                    current = blocks.get(bufferIndex);
                }
                nextRead = (int) (pos & blockMask);
                assert getPosition() == pos;
            }

            @Override
            public boolean reversed() {
                return true;
            }
        };
    }

    // ... [Rest of the class]
}
```

In this refactored version, `getReverseReader` has been removed, and its logic is directly integrated into `getReverseBytesReader`. This makes the class more concise and reduces unnecessary indirection. However, it's important to note that inlining methods should be done carefully, considering the overall readability and maintainability of the code. In this case, the inlining seems justified as the `getReverseReader` method is only used in one place and its logic is not overly complex.
