To refactor the provided code snippet using inline method refactorings, we should focus on the `testSkip` method. This method is a candidate for inlining because it encapsulates a simple behavior that could be directly incorporated into the calling context, enhancing readability and reducing the abstraction level.

The `testSkip` method is used within the `testSkip_RequiredCharsets` method. By inlining `testSkip`, we can place its logic directly into the `testSkip_RequiredCharsets` method. This makes the flow of the test more apparent and reduces the need to navigate between methods to understand what the test does.

Here's how the refactored code would look after applying inline method refactorings:

```java
package org.apache.commons.io.input;

// ... [other imports and class members] ...

public class CharSequenceInputStreamTest {

    // ... [other methods and members] ...

    @Test
    public void testSkip_RequiredCharsets() throws Exception {
        for (final String csName : getRequiredCharsetNames()) {
            try (InputStream r = new CharSequenceInputStream("test", csName)) {
                assertEquals(1, r.skip(1));
                assertEquals(2, r.skip(2));
                r.skip(100);
                assertEquals(-1, r.read(), csName);
            }
        }
    }

    // ... [other methods] ...
}
```

In this refactored code, the `testSkip` method's logic is moved directly into `testSkip_RequiredCharsets`. This change improves the readability of the test, as it's now clear what the test does without needing to reference an external method. Additionally, since `testSkip` was only used in one place, its removal simplifies the class structure.
