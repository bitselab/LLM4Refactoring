To refactor the given code snippet by employing inline method refactorings, I will integrate the logic of the `configure` method directly into the `configuration` method. This will eliminate the unnecessary `configure` method and streamline the process of generating the `Configuration` object. Here's the refactored code:

```java
package org.hibernate.search.util.impl.integrationtest.mapper.orm;

// ... [imports remain unchanged]

@SuppressWarnings("resource")
public final class DatabaseContainer {

    // ... [other members of the class remain unchanged]

    public static Configuration configuration() {
        if (!SupportedDatabase.H2.equals(DATABASE)) {
            DATABASE_CONTAINER.start();
        }
        Configuration configuration = DATABASE.configuration(DATABASE_CONTAINER);

        if (DATABASE_CONTAINER != null && !DATABASE_CONTAINER.isRunning()) {
            synchronized (DATABASE_CONTAINER) {
                if (!DATABASE_CONTAINER.isRunning()) {
                    DATABASE_CONTAINER.start();
                }
            }
        }

        return configuration;
    }

    // ... [rest of the class remains unchanged]
}
```

In this refactoring, the logic inside the `configure` method is directly placed into the `configuration` method. The `configure` method is removed as its purpose is now served within `configuration`. This change improves readability by reducing the number of methods and directly presenting the logic where it's used.
