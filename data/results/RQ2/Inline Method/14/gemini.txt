Sure, the provided code snippet contains an unnecessary method `introSort` that can be refactored using inline method refactoring. Here's the refactored code:

```java
public abstract class MSBRadixSorter extends Sorter {

  // ... other code ...

  protected void sort(int from, int to, int k, int l) {
    if (shouldFallback(from, to, l)) {
      // Inline the logic from introSort
      getFallbackSorter(k).sort(from, to);
    } else {
      radixSort(from, to, k, l);
    }
  }

  // ... other code ...
}
```

The original `introSort` method called `getFallbackSorter(k).sort(from, to)`. This logic is now directly placed within the `sort` method where `introSort` was called. This eliminates the need for a separate method and improves code readability.

By inlining the method, we reduce code duplication and make the code easier to understand. The sorting logic for the fallback scenario is now directly visible within the `sort` method.
