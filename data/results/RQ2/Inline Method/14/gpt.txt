To improve the readability of the `MSBRadixSorter` class, we can employ inline method refactoring on the `introSort` method. This method is a simple one-line wrapper around `getFallbackSorter(k).sort(from, to)`. By inlining this method directly into the call site within the `sort` method, we can eliminate the unnecessary indirection, making the code more straightforward.

Here's the refactored version of the `MSBRadixSorter` class with `introSort` inlined:

```java
package org.apache.lucene.util;

import java.util.Arrays;

/**
 * Radix sorter for variable-length strings. This class sorts based on the most significant byte
 * first and falls back to {@link IntroSorter} when the size of the buckets to sort becomes small.
 *
 * <p>This algorithm is <b>NOT</b> stable. Worst-case memory usage is about {@code 2.3 KB}.
 *
 * @lucene.internal
 */
public abstract class MSBRadixSorter extends Sorter {

    // ... [omitting unchanged class fields and constructor for brevity]

    protected abstract int byteAt(int i, int k);

    protected Sorter getFallbackSorter(int k) {
        // ... [omitting unchanged method implementation]
    }

    @Override
    protected final int compare(int i, int j) {
        // ... [omitting unchanged method implementation]
    }

    @Override
    public void sort(int from, int to) {
        checkRange(from, to);
        sort(from, to, 0, 0);
    }

    protected void sort(int from, int to, int k, int l) {
        if (shouldFallback(from, to, l)) {
            // Inlined the content of introSort method
            getFallbackSorter(k).sort(from, to);
        } else {
            radixSort(from, to, k, l);
        }
    }

    // ... [omitting other methods for brevity]

    private void radixSort(int from, int to, int k, int l) {
        // ... [omitting unchanged method implementation]
    }

    // ... [omitting additional methods for brevity]
}
```

### Explanation of Changes
- The `introSort` method has been removed.
- The single line of code from `introSort` has been directly placed in the `sort` method where `introSort` was previously called.

This change simplifies the code structure without impacting the readability or functionality, adhering to the principle of keeping code as simple and direct as possible.
