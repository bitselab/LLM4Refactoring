The method `getTargetClass(Object target)` in the provided code snippet is a simple wrapper around the `AopProxyUtils.ultimateTargetClass(target)` call. This method could be a candidate for inline refactoring, as it does little more than delegate to another method. Inline refactoring here would involve replacing calls to `getTargetClass(target)` with `AopProxyUtils.ultimateTargetClass(target)` directly in the code.

I will refactor the code to inline the `getTargetClass` method and show the updated sections where it is used.

```java
// Refactored sections of CacheAspectSupport class

@Override
public void afterPropertiesSet() {
    Assert.state(getCacheOperationSource() != null, "The 'cacheOperationSources' property is required: " +
            "If there are no cacheable methods, then don't use a cache aspect.");
}

@Override
public void afterSingletonsInstantiated() {
    if (getCacheResolver() == null) {
        // Lazily initialize cache resolver via default cache manager
        Assert.state(this.beanFactory != null, "CacheResolver or BeanFactory must be set on cache aspect");
        try {
            setCacheManager(this.beanFactory.getBean(CacheManager.class));
        }
        catch (NoUniqueBeanDefinitionException ex) {
            throw new IllegalStateException("No CacheResolver specified, and no unique bean of type " +
                    "CacheManager found. Mark one as primary or declare a specific CacheManager to use.", ex);
        }
        catch (NoSuchBeanDefinitionException ex) {
            throw new IllegalStateException("No CacheResolver specified, and no bean of type CacheManager found. " +
                    "Register a CacheManager bean or remove the @EnableCaching annotation from your configuration.", ex);
        }
    }
    this.initialized = true;
}

@Nullable
protected Object execute(CacheOperationInvoker invoker, Object target, Method method, Object[] args) {
    // Check whether aspect is enabled (to cope with cases where the AJ is pulled in automatically)
    if (this.initialized) {
        // Inlined getTargetClass method
        Class<?> targetClass = AopProxyUtils.ultimateTargetClass(target);

        CacheOperationSource cacheOperationSource = getCacheOperationSource();
        if (cacheOperationSource != null) {
            Collection<CacheOperation> operations = cacheOperationSource.getCacheOperations(method, targetClass);
            if (!CollectionUtils.isEmpty(operations)) {
                return execute(invoker, method, new CacheOperationContexts(operations, method, args, target, targetClass));
            }
        }
    }

    return invokeOperation(invoker);
}

// Rest of the class remains unchanged
```

In the refactored code:
- The call to `getTargetClass(target)` in the `execute` method is replaced with `AopProxyUtils.ultimateTargetClass(target)`.
- The `getTargetClass` method is removed as it's no longer needed.

This refactoring makes the code more direct and reduces the indirection caused by the simple wrapper method, potentially improving readability and performance slightly. However, the impact of such a change on a large and complex system like Spring's caching support should be carefully considered and tested.
