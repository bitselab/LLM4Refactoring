To apply inline variable refactoring to the `getUnderlyingFile` method in the provided code, we can remove the temporary variable `file` and return the result directly. This makes the code more concise without affecting its readability or functionality.

Here's the refactored `getUnderlyingFile` method:

```java
private File getUnderlyingFile(Resource resource) {
    try {
        if (resource instanceof ClassPathResource || resource instanceof FileSystemResource
                || resource instanceof FileUrlResource) {
            return resource.getFile().getAbsoluteFile();
        }
    } catch (IOException ex) {
        // Ignore
    }
    return null;
}
```

In this refactored version, the temporary `file` variable is eliminated, and `resource.getFile().getAbsoluteFile()` is returned directly. This change streamlines the method, making it more straightforward.
