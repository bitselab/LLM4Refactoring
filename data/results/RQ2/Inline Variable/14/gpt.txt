To apply the inline variable refactoring technique for improving readability in the specified code snippet, we can focus on the `testMergedFieldInfos_empty` method. In this method, the variable `expected` is used only once and can be directly inlined in the `assertSame` assertion. Here's how the refactored method would look:

```java
public void testMergedFieldInfos_empty() throws IOException {
    Directory dir = newDirectory();
    IndexWriter writer = new IndexWriter(dir, newIndexWriterConfig(new MockAnalyzer(random())));

    IndexReader reader = DirectoryReader.open(writer);
    FieldInfos actual = FieldInfos.getMergedFieldInfos(reader);

    assertSame(FieldInfos.EMPTY, actual); // Inlined 'expected' variable here

    reader.close();
    writer.close();
    dir.close();
}
```

In this refactored version, `FieldInfos.EMPTY` is directly used in the `assertSame` method instead of assigning it to the `expected` variable first. This makes the code slightly more concise without losing clarity.

It's important to note that inline variable refactoring should be used judiciously. It is most effective when the variable being inlined is used in a straightforward and clear context, as in this case.
