The suggested refactoring involves inlining the `threadPool` variable in the `LocalAction` constructor. This change will streamline the code by directly assigning the `retentionExecutor` without the intermediate step of assigning `threadPool`. Here's the refactored version of the `LocalAction` constructor:

Original Code:
```java
public LocalAction(TransportService transportService, RepositoriesService repositoriesService, ActionFilters actionFilters) {
    super(INSTANCE.name(), actionFilters, transportService.getTaskManager());
    this.repositoriesService = repositoriesService;
    final var threadPool = transportService.getThreadPool();
    this.retentionExecutor = threadPool.executor(ThreadPool.Names.MANAGEMENT);
}
```

Refactored Code:
```java
public LocalAction(TransportService transportService, RepositoriesService repositoriesService, ActionFilters actionFilters) {
    super(INSTANCE.name(), actionFilters, transportService.getTaskManager());
    this.repositoriesService = repositoriesService;
    this.retentionExecutor = transportService.getThreadPool().executor(ThreadPool.Names.MANAGEMENT);
}
```

In the refactored code, `transportService.getThreadPool().executor(ThreadPool.Names.MANAGEMENT)` is directly assigned to `this.retentionExecutor`. This change improves readability by reducing the number of lines and eliminating a variable that is used only once. It's a small but effective improvement in terms of code clarity and simplicity.
