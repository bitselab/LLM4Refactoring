To improve the readability of the `MutationExecutorStandard` constructor in the provided Java code snippet, we can apply inline variable refactoring. This technique is particularly useful in cases where a variable is only used once and its removal does not reduce code clarity. 

In the specified section, the variable `selfExecutingMutation` is a good candidate for inline refactoring. It is immediately added to a list and does not add significant clarity to the code. Let's refactor this part and any other similar opportunities in the constructor. 

Here's the refactored code:

```java
public MutationExecutorStandard(
        MutationOperationGroup mutationOperationGroup,
        BatchKeyAccess batchKeySupplier,
        int batchSize,
        SharedSessionContractImplementor session) {
    this.mutationOperationGroup = mutationOperationGroup;
    this.generatedValuesDelegate = mutationOperationGroup.asEntityMutationOperationGroup() != null ?
            mutationOperationGroup.asEntityMutationOperationGroup().getMutationDelegate() :
            null;

    final BatchKey batchKey = batchKeySupplier.getBatchKey();

    // Split the table operations into batchable and non-batchable
    // 1. Batchable statements are handled via Batch
    // 2. Non-batchable statements are handled locally

    List<PreparableMutationOperation> batchedJdbcMutations = null;
    List<PreparableMutationOperation> nonBatchedJdbcMutations = null;
    List<SelfExecutingUpdateOperation> selfExecutingMutations = null;

    boolean hasAnyNonBatchedJdbcOperations = false;

    for (int i = mutationOperationGroup.getNumberOfOperations() - 1; i >= 0; i--) {
        MutationOperation operation = mutationOperationGroup.getOperation(i);
        if (operation instanceof SelfExecutingUpdateOperation) {
            if (selfExecutingMutations == null) {
                selfExecutingMutations = new ArrayList<>();
            }
            selfExecutingMutations.add(0, (SelfExecutingUpdateOperation) operation);
        } else {
            PreparableMutationOperation preparableMutationOperation = (PreparableMutationOperation) operation;
            TableMapping tableDetails = operation.getTableDetails();
            boolean canBeBatched;

            if (tableDetails.isIdentifierTable() && hasAnyNonBatchedJdbcOperations) {
                canBeBatched = false;
            }
            else {
                canBeBatched = preparableMutationOperation.canBeBatched(batchKey, batchSize);
            }

            if (canBeBatched) {
                if (batchedJdbcMutations == null) {
                    batchedJdbcMutations = new ArrayList<>();
                }
                batchedJdbcMutations.add(0, preparableMutationOperation);
                statementLocationMap.put(tableDetails.getTableName(), StatementLocation.BATCHED);
            } else {
                hasAnyNonBatchedJdbcOperations = true;
                if (nonBatchedJdbcMutations == null) {
                    nonBatchedJdbcMutations = new ArrayList<>();
                }
                nonBatchedJdbcMutations.add(0, preparableMutationOperation);
                statementLocationMap.put(tableDetails.getTableName(), StatementLocation.NON_BATCHED);
            }
        }
    }

    // ... (rest of the constructor)
}
```

Key Changes:
1. **Inlined `selfExecutingMutation` Variable**: The variable `selfExecutingMutation` was inlined directly into the `add` method call of the `selfExecutingMutations` list. This streamlines the code, as the variable is only used once and its presence does not add significant clarity.

2. **Simplified Casting**: When adding to `selfExecutingMutations`, the casting is done directly within the `add` method.

These changes improve readability and maintain the original functionality of the code. Note that this refactoring focuses on a specific part of the code due to its length. Similar inline variable refactorings can be applied throughout the code wherever applicable.
