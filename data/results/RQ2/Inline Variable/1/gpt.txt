In the provided code snippet, the `origQuery` variable in the `extract` method is a candidate for inline variable refactoring. This variable is assigned the value of `query` and is only used once in a subsequent conditional statement. Inline refactoring in this context can help to streamline the code by reducing unnecessary variable assignments and improving readability.

Let's perform the inline variable refactoring for `origQuery`:

```java
protected void extract(Query query, float boost, Map<String, WeightedSpanTerm> terms)
        throws IOException {
    // ... [previous code remains unchanged]

    else {
        if (query instanceof MultiTermQuery
                && (!expandMultiTermQuery || !fieldNameComparator(((MultiTermQuery) query).getField()))) {
            return;
        }

        final IndexReader reader = getLeafContext().reader();
        Query rewritten;
        if (query instanceof MultiTermQuery) {
            rewritten = MultiTermQuery.SCORING_BOOLEAN_REWRITE.rewrite(
                            new IndexSearcher(reader), (MultiTermQuery) query);
        } else {
            rewritten = query.rewrite(new IndexSearcher(reader));
        }

        if (rewritten != query) {
            // only rewrite once and then flatten again - the rewritten query could have a special
            // treatment if this method is overwritten in a subclass or above in the next recursion
            extract(rewritten, boost, terms);
        } else {
            extractUnknownQuery(query, terms);
        }
    }
}
```

In this refactored code, I have inlined the `origQuery` variable directly into the condition (`if (rewritten != query)`) where it's used. This change makes the code more concise without affecting the logic or readability. Other parts of the method remain unchanged.
