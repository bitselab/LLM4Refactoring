 **Here's the refactored code with the unnecessary variable `refToCheck` inlined:**

```java
public Ref call() throws GitAPIException, RefAlreadyExistsException,
        RefNotFoundException, InvalidRefNameException {
    checkCallable();
    processOptions();
    try (RevWalk revWalk = new RevWalk(repo)) {
        boolean exists = repo.findRef(R_HEADS + name) != null;
        if (!force && exists) {
            throw new RefAlreadyExistsException(MessageFormat.format(
                    JGitText.get().refAlreadyExists1, name));
        }

        ObjectId startAt = getStartPointObjectId();
        String startPointFullName = null;
        if (startPoint != null) {
            Ref baseRef = repo.findRef(startPoint);
            if (baseRef != null)
                startPointFullName = baseRef.getName();
        }

        // ... rest of the code remains unchanged ...
```

**Explanation of the refactoring:**

1. **Identifying the unnecessary variable:** The variable `refToCheck` was only used once to check if the branch existed. Its value was immediately used in the `exists` variable, making `refToCheck` redundant.

2. **Inlining the variable:** We replaced all occurrences of `refToCheck` with the expression that retrieves its value, which is `repo.findRef(R_HEADS + name)`. This eliminates the need for the variable itself.

**Benefits of inlining:**

- **Improved readability:** By removing an extra variable, the code becomes more concise and easier to read.
- **Reduced memory usage:** Although the impact in this case is likely minimal, inlining variables can help reduce memory usage, especially in larger codebases.

**Additional notes:**

- Refactoring often involves multiple small changes like this to improve code quality.
- It's important to balance readability with other factors like performance when refactoring.
- Consider using automated refactoring tools to assist with these tasks and ensure code consistency.
