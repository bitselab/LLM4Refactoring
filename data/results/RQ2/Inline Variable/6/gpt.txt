To improve the readability of the `setUpMocks` method in the provided code, we can apply inline variable refactoring to the `rpcServerField` variable. This variable is only used once, immediately after its declaration, so inlining it would streamline the method without affecting readability or functionality.

**Original Code Snippet:**
```java
private static void setUpMocks() throws IOException, NoSuchFieldException {
    // ... other code ...

    Field rpcServerField = Router.class.getDeclaredField("rpcServer");
    FieldSetter.setField(routerContext.getRouter(), rpcServerField, spyRpcServer);

    // ... other code ...
}
```

**Refactored Code Snippet:**
```java
private static void setUpMocks() throws IOException, NoSuchFieldException {
    // ... other code ...

    FieldSetter.setField(routerContext.getRouter(), Router.class.getDeclaredField("rpcServer"), spyRpcServer);

    // ... other code ...
}
```

In the refactored code, the `rpcServerField` variable is eliminated, and its usage is inlined directly into the `FieldSetter.setField` method call. This change makes the code more concise without reducing clarity.
