 **Here's the refactored code with the unnecessary variable "doc" removed using inline variable refactoring:**

```java
@SuppressForbidden(reason = "This module does not need to deal with logging context")
public Iterator<SolrInputDocument> preGenerate(int numDocs) throws InterruptedException {
  log("preGenerate docs=" + numDocs + " ...");
  docs.clear();
  executorService =
      Executors.newFixedThreadPool(
          Runtime.getRuntime().availableProcessors() + 1,
          new SolrNamedThreadFactory("SolrJMH DocMaker"));

  for (int i = 0; i < numDocs; i++) {
    executorService.submit(() -> {
      docs.add(Docs.this.inputDocument()); // Inline "doc" variable
    });
  }

  // ... (rest of the code remains unchanged)
}
```

**Explanation of the refactoring:**

- The original code declared a variable `doc` inside the `executorService.submit` block. Its only purpose was to hold the result of calling `Docs.this.inputDocument()` and then pass it to the `docs.add` method.
- By inlining the variable, we can eliminate the need for `doc` altogether, making the code more concise and easier to read.
- Using the expression `Docs.this.inputDocument()` directly within the `docs.add` method achieves the same functionality without an intermediary variable.
