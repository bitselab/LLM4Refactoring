 **Here's the refactored code with the unnecessary variable "result" removed using inline variable refactoring:**

```java
@Override
@NonNull InputStream getInputStream() {
    return stream;
}
```

**Explanation of the refactoring:**

- The original code declared a variable `result` inside the `getInputStream` method, but its only purpose was to hold the value of the `stream` field before returning it.
- By directly returning the `stream` field, we eliminate the need for the intermediary variable, making the code more concise and easier to read.
- This refactoring maintains the same functionality while improving code readability.
