 **Here's the refactored code with the unnecessary variable "handler" removed using inline variable refactoring:**

```java
private MessageHandler createLateReplier(final CountDownLatch latch, final AtomicReference<Throwable> failure) {
    return message -> {
        try {
            Thread.sleep(500);
            MessageChannel replyChannel = (MessageChannel) message.getHeaders().getReplyChannel();
            replyChannel.send(new GenericMessage<>("response"));
            failure.set(new IllegalStateException("Expected exception"));
        } catch (InterruptedException e) {
            failure.set(e);
        } catch (MessageDeliveryException ex) {
            String expected = "Reply message received but the receiving thread has exited due to a timeout";
            String actual = ex.getMessage();
            if (!expected.equals(actual)) {
                failure.set(new IllegalStateException(
                        "Unexpected error: '" + actual + "'"));
            }
        } finally {
            latch.countDown();
        }
    };
}
```

**Explanation of the refactoring:**

- The original code declared a variable `handler` inside the `createLateReplier` method. Its only purpose was to hold a lambda expression that represented a delayed message handler.
- By directly returning the lambda expression without assigning it to `handler`, we eliminate the need for the variable and make the code more concise.
- This refactoring maintains the same functionality while improving readability.
