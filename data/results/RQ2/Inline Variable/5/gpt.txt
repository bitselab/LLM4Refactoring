The provided code snippet from the `StateBackendLoader` class can be improved by applying inline variable refactoring. This technique is beneficial for variables that are immediately returned or passed into another method and don't add to the understanding of the code. Here, the variable `fromConfig` in the `loadFromApplicationOrConfigOrDefaultInternal` method can be inlined for improved readability.

Here's the refactored version of the method:

```java
private static StateBackend loadFromApplicationOrConfigOrDefaultInternal(
        @Nullable StateBackend fromApplication,
        Configuration config,
        ClassLoader classLoader,
        @Nullable Logger logger)
        throws IllegalConfigurationException, DynamicCodeLoadingException, IOException {

    checkNotNull(config, "config");
    checkNotNull(classLoader, "classLoader");

    // (1) the application-defined state backend has precedence
    if (fromApplication != null) {
        if (fromApplication instanceof ConfigurableStateBackend) {
            // needs to pick up configuration
            if (logger != null) {
                logger.info("Using job/cluster config to configure application-defined state backend: {}", fromApplication);
            }

            return ((ConfigurableStateBackend) fromApplication).configure(config, classLoader);
        } else {
            // keep as is!
            return fromApplication;
        }
    } else {
        // (2) check if the config defines a state backend
        return loadStateBackendFromConfig(config, classLoader, logger);
    }
}
```

In this refactored version:

- The `backend` variable is removed, and the method returns directly from within the `if-else` blocks.
-

This direct return approach simplifies the method by removing unnecessary temporary variables, thereby improving the code's readability and maintainability.

It's important to note that while inline variable refactoring often makes the code more concise, it's crucial to apply this technique judiciously. In cases where a variable name adds significant semantic meaning or where the expression is complex, keeping the variable might be preferable for clarity. 

In this specific instance, however, the inline refactoring makes the method more straightforward without sacrificing readability or understanding of what the method does.
