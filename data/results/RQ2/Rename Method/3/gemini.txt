 **Here's the refactored code with a more descriptive method name:**

```java
package org.apache.commons.lang3.builder;

// ... (rest of the code remains the same)

@Test
public void testDefaultToStringStyle() {
  final DiffResult<SimpleClass> diffResult = new DiffResult<>(SIMPLE_TRUE, SIMPLE_FALSE, SIMPLE_TRUE.diff(SIMPLE_FALSE).getDiffs(),
      ToStringStyle.DEFAULT_STYLE, DiffBuilder.TO_STRING_FORMAT);
  assertEquals(ToStringStyle.DEFAULT_STYLE, diffResult.getToStringStyle());
}

// ... (rest of the code remains the same)
```

**Explanation of the refactoring:**

- **Original method name:** `testNullStyle()`
- **Refactored method name:** `testDefaultToStringStyle()`

**Improvements:**

- **Clarity:** The new name explicitly conveys what the test is actually verifying, which is the behavior of the `getToStringStyle()` method when the default style is used. This makes the test's intent clearer and easier to understand.
- **Consistency:** The new name aligns with other test names in the class that also use more descriptive wording to describe their focus.
- **Accuracy:** The original name implied a focus on "null styles," which is not directly relevant to the test's core functionality. The new name more accurately reflects what the test is checking.

**Additional notes:**

- The rest of the code remains the same, as the refactoring only involves renaming a method.
- Choosing descriptive method names is essential for both production code and test cases to enhance readability and maintainability.
