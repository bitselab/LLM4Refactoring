Here's the refactored code with a more descriptive method name:

```java
@Test
public void testPartialReadWithoutDataAtEnd() throws Exception {
  int fileIdx = 0;
  for (int i = 0; i <= 4; i++) {
    for (int j = 0; j <= 2; j++) {
      int fileSize = (int) Math.pow(2, i) * 256 * ONE_KB;
      int footerReadBufferSize = (int) Math.pow(2, j) * 256 * ONE_KB;
      final AzureBlobFileSystem fs = getFileSystem(
          true, fileSize, footerReadBufferSize);
      String fileName = methodName.getMethodName() + fileIdx++;
      byte[] fileContent = getRandomBytesArray(fileSize);
      Path testFilePath = createFileWithContent(fs, fileName, fileContent);
      testPartialReadWithNoData(fs, testFilePath,
          fileSize - AbfsInputStream.FOOTER_SIZE, AbfsInputStream.FOOTER_SIZE,
          fileContent, footerReadBufferSize);
    }
  }
}
```

**Explanation of the refactoring:**

- **Original method name:** `testPartialReadWithNoDat()`
- **Refactored method name:** `testPartialReadWithoutDataAtEnd()` 

**Improvements:**

- **Clarity:** The new name, `testPartialReadWithoutDataAtEnd()`, clearly describes the purpose of the test, which is to test a partial read scenario where there is no data remaining after the footer. This makes it easier to understand what the test is doing.
- **Accuracy:** The original name, `testPartialReadWithNoDat`, could be interpreted in multiple ways. It's not clear if "NoDat" refers to "no data" or a typo. The new name is more accurate and avoids confusion.
- **Readability:** The new name is longer but improves readability by using complete words and avoiding abbreviations.

**Additional notes:**

- The rest of the code remains unchanged.
- Using more descriptive method names enhances code maintainability and makes it easier for other developers to understand the code's purpose.
