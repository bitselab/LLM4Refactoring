In the provided code snippet, the method `testPartialReadWithNoDat()` seems to have a typo in its name, likely intended to be `testPartialReadWithNoData()`. Renaming this method would improve the readability and professionalism of the code. Here's how the refactored method would look:

```java
@Test
public void testPartialReadWithNoData() throws Exception {
    int fileIdx = 0;
    for (int i = 0; i <= 4; i++) {
        for (int j = 0; j <= 2; j++) {
            int fileSize = (int) Math.pow(2, i) * 256 * ONE_KB;
            int footerReadBufferSize = (int) Math.pow(2, j) * 256 * ONE_KB;
            final AzureBlobFileSystem fs = getFileSystem(
                    true, fileSize, footerReadBufferSize);
            String fileName = methodName.getMethodName() + fileIdx++;
            byte[] fileContent = getRandomBytesArray(fileSize);
            Path testFilePath = createFileWithContent(fs, fileName, fileContent);
            performPartialReadWithNoDataTest(fs, testFilePath,
                    fileSize - AbfsInputStream.FOOTER_SIZE, AbfsInputStream.FOOTER_SIZE,
                    fileContent, footerReadBufferSize);
        }
    }
}
```

Additionally, I also suggest renaming the method implementation from `testPartialReadWithNoData(fs, testFilePath, fileSize - AbfsInputStream.FOOTER_SIZE, AbfsInputStream.FOOTER_SIZE, fileContent, footerReadBufferSize)` to `performPartialReadWithNoDataTest(...)` to align with the naming convention of other methods in the code and to clarify that it is a utility method that performs the actual testing logic.

This rename makes the code more understandable and corrects the spelling mistake, thereby improving the overall quality of the codebase.
