 **Here's the refactored code with a more descriptive method name:**

```java
public class LBHttp2SolrClient extends LBSolrClient {
  // ... rest of the class code remains the same ...

  public static class Builder {
    // ... other builder methods remain the same ...

    /**
     * Sets the default data store (collection or core) to use for requests.
     *
     * @param defaultDataStore the name of the collection or core to use by default
     */
    public LBHttp2SolrClient.Builder setDefaultDataStore(String defaultDataStore) {
      this.defaultDataStore = defaultDataStore;
      return this;
    }

    // ... other builder methods remain the same ...
  }
}
```

**Explanation of the change:**

- **Original method name:** `withDefaultCollection`
- **Refactored method name:** `setDefaultDataStore`

**Improvements:**

- **Clarity:** The new name directly conveys its purpose of setting a default data store, making it easier to understand for both current and future developers.
- **Accuracy:** It accurately reflects the behavior of the method as described in the Javadoc comment.
- **Consistency:** It aligns with naming conventions in Java and Solr, where a method that sets a property often starts with "set".
- **Readability:** It improves readability by using a more descriptive and intuitive name.

**Benefits of this refactoring:**

- **Enhanced code comprehension:** Clearer method names make it easier to grasp the overall logic and flow of the code.
- **Improved maintainability:** Descriptive names make the code easier to maintain and modify in the future.
- **Better code collaboration:** Clearer method names facilitate communication and understanding among developers.
