Absolutely! Here's the refactored code with a more descriptive method name:

```java
private static CharSequence replaceInsensitiveOccurrences(
    CharSequence string, CharSequence sequenceToEscape, CharSequence escapeChar, Locale locale) {
  // ... rest of the method code remains the same ...
}
```

**Explanation:**

- **Clarity:** "replaceInsensitiveOccurrences" clearly conveys the method's purpose - replacing occurrences of a sequence within a string while ignoring case sensitivity.
- **Accuracy:** It maintains the original functionality of considering the escape character and handling empty search strings.
- **Readability:** The new name enhances understanding of the method's behavior at a glance.

**Additional considerations:**

- **Context:** If the method is used in a specific context within the `EscapeQuerySyntaxImpl` class, the name could further reflect that context (e.g., `escapeTermInsensitiveOccurrences`).
- **Consistency:** Ensure the new name adheres to the existing naming conventions used within your codebase.

By applying this refactoring, you improve the code's maintainability and readability for yourself and other developers.
