The method `test()` in the `OnSuccessFailingStaticFieldCase` class can indeed benefit from a rename to better describe its intent. The current name `test()` is too generic and does not provide any information about what the test is supposed to do. A more descriptive name could be `verifyOnSuccessCleanupFailsForStaticField` which clearly states that the test is intended to verify the behavior of the `ON_SUCCESS` cleanup mode for a static field, particularly when the test fails.

Let's apply this renaming in the refactored code:

```java
package org.junit.jupiter.engine.extension;

// ... [imports remain the same]

class TempDirectoryCleanupTests extends AbstractJupiterTestEngineTests {

    // ... [Other nested classes and methods remain the same]

    @TestMethodOrder(MethodOrderer.OrderAnnotation.class)
    static class OnSuccessFailingStaticFieldCase {

        @TempDir(cleanup = ON_SUCCESS)
        static Path onSuccessFailingFieldDir;

        @Test
        @Order(1)
        void verifyOnSuccessCleanupFailsForStaticField() {
            TempDirFieldTests.onSuccessFailingFieldDir = onSuccessFailingFieldDir;
            fail();
        }

        @Test
        @Order(2)
        void passing() {
            // Implementation of the test
        }
    }

    // ... [Rest of the class remains the same]

}
```

This refactoring focuses on improving the semantics of the method name to provide better context and understanding of the test's purpose. The functionality of the test remains unchanged.
