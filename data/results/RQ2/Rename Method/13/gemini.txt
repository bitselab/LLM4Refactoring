 **Here's the refactored code with a more descriptive method name:**

```java
@Test
@Order(1)
void testTempDirFieldCleanupOnSuccessFailure() {
  TempDirFieldTests.onSuccessFailingFieldDir = onSuccessFailingFieldDir;
  fail();
}
```

**Key improvements:**

- **Clarity:** The new name clearly conveys what's being tested: checking if the temporary directory is cleaned up or not when a test fails using the `ON_SUCCESS` cleanup mode.
- **Context:** It incorporates relevant context from the method's functionality and class structure.
- **Readability:** It aids in understanding the test's purpose at a glance.

**Additional recommendations for effective refactoring:**

- **Consistent naming conventions:** Adhere to established naming conventions within the codebase to maintain uniformity.
- **Consider test granularity:**  If a method tests multiple scenarios, consider breaking it down into smaller, more focused tests for better readability and maintainability.
- **Involve team input:** Seek feedback from developers working on the same codebase to ensure the new name resonates with their understanding of the code.

**Remember:**

- **Regression testing:** After refactoring, rigorously test to ensure the code still functions as intended.
- **Version control:** Use version control to track changes and revert back if any unintended consequences occur.
