 **Here's the refactored code with a more descriptive method name:**

```java
@Test
public void shouldVerifyStackTraceFilteringForUserExceptionsWithReflectionForJavaVersionsLessThan21() {
  // ... rest of the test code remains the same ...
}
```

**Explanation of the change:**

- **Clarity:** The new name directly conveys the test's purpose: verifying that stack traces are filtered correctly for user exceptions when using reflection in Java versions older than 21.
- **Accuracy:** It accurately reflects the specific conditions being tested.
- **Readability:** It makes the test's intent clear at a glance, improving code comprehension.

**Additional considerations:**

- **Conventions:** Adhere to existing test naming conventions in your codebase for consistency.
- **Context:** If the test fits within a broader context, consider incorporating that into the name (e.g., `shouldVerifyStackTraceFilteringForUserExceptionsWithReflectionForJavaVersionsLessThan21InPartialMockingScenario`).

**Benefits of the refactoring:**

- **Enhanced readability:** Clearer method names make the code easier to understand and maintain.
- **Improved communication:** Meaningful names aid collaboration and knowledge sharing within the development team.
- **Easier test management:** Well-named tests simplify test organization and navigation.

By applying this renaming refactoring, you've made the code more self-explanatory and strengthened its maintainability.
