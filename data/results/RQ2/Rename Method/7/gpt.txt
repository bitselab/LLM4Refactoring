In the provided code snippet, the method `performInsert` can benefit from a rename method refactoring. The current name `performInsert` is somewhat generic and does not fully convey the method's purpose and functionality. A more descriptive name would enhance readability and maintainability of the code.

A suggested new name for `performInsert` could be `executeInsertAndLogDetails`. This name better describes the method's operations: it performs an insert operation and also logs the details of the SQL statement being executed.

Here is the refactored code with the renamed method:

```java
package org.hibernate.id.insert;

// ... [import statements]

public abstract class AbstractReturningDelegate extends AbstractGeneratedValuesMutationDelegate
        implements InsertGeneratedIdentifierDelegate {

    // ... [other methods and constructors]

    @Override
    public GeneratedValues executeInsertAndLogDetails(
            PreparedStatementDetails statementDetails,
            JdbcValueBindings valueBindings,
            Object entity,
            SharedSessionContractImplementor session) {
        session.getJdbcServices().getSqlStatementLogger().logStatement( statementDetails.getSqlString() );
        valueBindings.beforeStatement( statementDetails );
        return executeAndExtractReturning( statementDetails.getSqlString(), statementDetails.getStatement(), session );
    }

    // ... [rest of the class]

}
```

In this refactor:
- The method `performInsert` has been renamed to `executeInsertAndLogDetails`.
- The new name provides a clearer understanding of the method's actions, indicating that it not only performs an insert operation but also logs the SQL statement details.
