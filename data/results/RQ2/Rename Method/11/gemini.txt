Absolutely, you can refactor the `setupEnvironment` method using a rename method refactoring to improve readability. Here's the refactored code:

```java
private void prepareJettyEnvironment() throws Exception {
  // Existing code inside the method remains the same
}
```

The original method name `setupEnvironment` is quite generic. The new name `prepareJettyEnvironment` is more specific and clearly indicates the purpose of the method - to prepare the Jetty environment for the tests. This improves the code's readability and maintainability.

Here's a breakdown of the steps involved in the refactoring process:

1. **Identify the method to rename:** In this case, the method `setupEnvironment`.
2. **Choose a new name:** The new name should be descriptive and accurately reflect the method's functionality. Here, `prepareJettyEnvironment` is a more precise name.
3. **Refactor the code:** Use your IDE's refactoring tools to rename the method. Most IDEs will automatically update all references to the method name throughout your codebase.

By following these steps, you can improve the readability and maintainability of your code using rename method refactoring.
