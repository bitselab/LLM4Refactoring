Absolutely, here's the refactored code with an improved method name:

```java
public static String calculateRelativePath(String baseDirectory, String path) {
  String resultPath;
  if (baseDirectory == null) {
    resultPath = path;
  } else {
    final Path pathAbsolute = Paths.get(path);
    final Path pathBase = Paths.get(baseDirectory);
    resultPath = pathBase.relativize(pathAbsolute).toString();
  }
  return resultPath;
}
```

The original method name `relativizeAndNormalizePath` was descriptive but contained two functionalities. By renaming it to `calculateRelativePath`, we focus on the core functionality of the method, which is to calculate the relative path between two paths.
