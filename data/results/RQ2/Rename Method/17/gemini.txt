 **Here's the refactored code with a more descriptive method name:**

```java
@ParameterizedTest
@ValueSource(ints = {11, 17, 21})
void loadFromJRTFileSystemOfSpecificJavaVersion(int javaVersion) throws IOException {
  // ... rest of the method code remains the same ...
}
```

**Explanation:**

- **Clarity:** The new name `loadFromJRTFileSystemOfSpecificJavaVersion` explicitly conveys its purpose of loading classes from the JRT file system (jrt-fs.jar) associated with a particular Java version.
- **Accuracy:** It accurately reflects the method's behavior as described in the Javadoc comment.
- **Readability:** The detailed name makes the code self-explanatory, immediately clarifying what the method does and the context in which it's used.

**Additional considerations:**

- **Context:** If the method is used within a specific context like testing class loading logic, a more targeted name could be `testLoadingClassesFromJRTFileSystemForSpecificJavaVersion`.
- **Consistency:** Ensure the new name adheres to existing naming conventions in your codebase.

**Benefits of this refactoring:**

- **Improved code readability:** The code becomes easier to understand and maintain for both current and future developers.
- **Enhanced code comprehension:** Clearer method names make it easier to grasp the overall logic and flow of the code.
- **Better code organization:** Refactoring often involves reorganizing code structures, leading to better maintainability and potential for future enhancements.
