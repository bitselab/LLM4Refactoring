 **Here's the refactored code with a more descriptive method name:**

```java
package org.springframework.boot.autoconfigure.security.oauth2.client.servlet;

// ... rest of the class code remains the same ...

private List<Filter> extractFiltersOfType(AssertableWebApplicationContext context, Class<? extends Filter> filterType) {
    return getSecurityFilterChain(context).getFilters().stream().filter(filterType::isInstance).toList();
}

// ... other methods remain the same ...
```

**Explanation of the change:**

- **Original method name:** `getFilters`
- **Refactored method name:** `extractFiltersOfType`

**Improvements:**

- **Clarity:** The new name clearly states that the method extracts filters of a specific type, making its purpose more explicit.
- **Specificity:** It accurately reflects the use of `filterType` to filter the filters, avoiding potential ambiguity.
- **Consistency:** It aligns with naming conventions in Java and Spring Security, where methods that extract elements often start with "extract" or "get" followed by a description of what's being extracted.
- **Readability:** It improves readability by using a more descriptive and intuitive name.

**Benefits of this refactoring:**

- **Enhanced code comprehension:** Clearer method names make it easier to grasp the overall logic and flow of the code.
- **Improved maintainability:** Descriptive names make the code easier to maintain and modify in the future.
- **Better code collaboration:** Clearer method names facilitate communication and understanding among developers.
