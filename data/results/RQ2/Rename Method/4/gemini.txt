Absolutely! Here's the refactored code with a more descriptive method name:

```java
package org.elasticsearch.xpack.ql.util;

// ... (rest of the code remains the same)

public enum SpatialCoordinateTypes {
  // ... (other code remains the same)

  public BytesRef geometryToWkb(Geometry geometry) {
    return new BytesRef(WellKnownBinary.toWKB(geometry, ByteOrder.LITTLE_ENDIAN));
  }

  // ... (rest of the code remains the same)
}
```

**Explanation of the refactoring:**

- **Original method name:** `pointAsWKB(Geometry geometry)`
- **Refactored method name:** `geometryToWkb(Geometry geometry)`

**Improvements:**

- **Clarity:** The new name, `geometryToWkb`, explicitly conveys the purpose of the method, which is to convert a `Geometry` object to its Well-Known Binary (WKB) representation. This makes it clearer what the method does and avoids the ambiguity of assuming it only works with points.
- **Accuracy:** The original name, `pointAsWKB`, implied the method only handles points, which wasn't entirely accurate. The method can handle any geometry type supported by Well-Known Binary.
- **Consistency:** The naming convention in the class uses methods like `longAsPoint` and `pointAsLong` to describe conversions between specific types. This refactoring aligns with that pattern.

**Additional notes:**

- The rest of the code remains unchanged.
- Using descriptive method names enhances code readability and maintainability.
