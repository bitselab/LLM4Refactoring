The method `isValid(Annotation annotation)` in the provided code snippet can be renamed for better clarity and readability. The current name, `isValid`, is somewhat generic and does not fully convey the method's purpose. Since this method checks if the values from a given annotation can be safely accessed without causing any `TypeNotPresentException`, a more descriptive name could be `areAnnotationValuesAccessible`.

Here's how the code snippet would look after applying this rename refactoring:

```java
package org.springframework.core.annotation;

// ... (other imports and class members remain unchanged) ...

final class AttributeMethods {

    // ... (other methods and fields remain unchanged) ...

    /**
     * Determine if values from the given annotation can be safely accessed without
     * causing any {@link TypeNotPresentException TypeNotPresentExceptions}.
     * <p>This method is designed to cover Google App Engine's late arrival of such
     * exceptions for {@code Class} values (instead of the more typical early
     * {@code Class.getAnnotations() failure} on a regular JVM).
     * @param annotation the annotation to check
     * @return {@code true} if all values are present
     * @see #validate(Annotation)
     */
    boolean areAnnotationValuesAccessible(Annotation annotation) {
        assertAnnotation(annotation);
        for (int i = 0; i < size(); i++) {
            if (canThrowTypeNotPresentException(i)) {
                try {
                    AnnotationUtils.invokeAnnotationMethod(get(i), annotation);
                }
                catch (IllegalStateException ex) {
                    // Plain invocation failure to expose -> leave up to attribute retrieval
                    // (if any) where such invocation failure will be logged eventually.
                }
                catch (Throwable ex) {
                    // TypeNotPresentException etc. -> annotation type not actually loadable.
                    return false;
                }
            }
        }
        return true;
    }

    // ... (other methods and fields remain unchanged) ...

    // ... (rest of the class remains unchanged) ...
}
```

This rename makes it clearer what the method does, specifically that it checks the accessibility of annotation values, not just the validity of the annotation itself. This kind of renaming improves code readability and maintainability.
