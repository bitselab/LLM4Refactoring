Absolutely, the current method name `isValid` doesn't fully convey its purpose. Here's the refactored code with a more descriptive name:

```java
boolean canSafelyAccessAttributeValues(Annotation annotation) {
  // ... rest of the method code remains the same ...
}
```

**Explanation:**

- **Clarity:** "canSafelyAccessAttributeValues" clearly describes the method's functionality - checking if accessing annotation attribute values is possible without encountering `TypeNotPresentException`.
- **Accuracy:** It maintains the original behavior of handling potential exceptions.
- **Readability:** The new name enhances understanding of the method's intent at a glance.

**Additional considerations:**

- **Context:** If the method is used within a specific context related to attribute methods, the name could be further refined (e.g., `canSafelyInvokeAttributeMethods`).
- **Consistency:** Ensure the new name adheres to existing naming conventions within your codebase.

By applying this renaming refactoring, you improve the code's readability and maintainability for yourself and other developers.
