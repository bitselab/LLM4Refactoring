In the provided code snippet, the variable name `executionId` in the `simple()` method can be improved for better readability. The current name `executionId` implies that the variable holds an ID, but actually, it holds an object of type `JobExecution`. A more appropriate name would reflect the type of object it is holding. Renaming it to something like `jobExecution` would make the code clearer. 

Here is the refactored version of the `simple()` method with the variable renamed:

```java
@Test
public void simple() throws InterruptedException, IOException {
    List<Company> companies = JobTestUtil.findIndexedResults(emf, Company.class, "name", "Google");
    List<Person> people = JobTestUtil.findIndexedResults(emf, Person.class, "firstName", "Linus");
    List<WhoAmI> whos = JobTestUtil.findIndexedResults(emf, WhoAmI.class, "id", "id01");
    assertEquals(0, companies.size());
    assertEquals(0, people.size());
    assertEquals(0, whos.size());

    JobExecution jobExecution = JobTestUtil.startJobAndWaitForSuccessNoRetry(
            MassIndexingJob.parameters()
                    .forEntities(Company.class, Person.class, WhoAmI.class)
                    .checkpointInterval(CHECKPOINT_INTERVAL)
                    .build()
    );
    assertProgress(jobExecution, Person.class, INSTANCE_PER_ENTITY_TYPE);
    assertProgress(jobExecution, Company.class, INSTANCE_PER_ENTITY_TYPE);
    assertProgress(jobExecution, WhoAmI.class, INSTANCE_PER_ENTITY_TYPE);

    companies = JobTestUtil.findIndexedResults(emf, Company.class, "name", "Google");
    people = JobTestUtil.findIndexedResults(emf, Person.class, "firstName", "Linus");
    whos = JobTestUtil.findIndexedResults(emf, WhoAmI.class, "id", "id01");
    assertEquals(INSTANCES_PER_DATA_TEMPLATE, companies.size());
    assertEquals(INSTANCES_PER_DATA_TEMPLATE, people.size());
    assertEquals(INSTANCES_PER_DATA_TEMPLATE, whos.size());
}
```

This change enhances the readability of the code by providing a clearer indication of what the variable `jobExecution` represents. It is now evident that it is an object of type `JobExecution` rather than just an ID. This kind of renaming is a simple yet effective way to make code more understandable and maintainable.
