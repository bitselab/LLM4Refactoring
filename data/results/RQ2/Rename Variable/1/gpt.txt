To improve the readability of the code snippet you provided, we'll focus on the method `getNearestNode`. In this method, the variable `tag` does not accurately describe its purpose or function, which can lead to confusion for anyone reading the code. A more descriptive name would enhance the clarity of the code.

Given the context, the variable represents a `DetailNode` that is being iterated to find the nearest relevant node that is not a `LEADING_ASTERISK` or `NEWLINE`. Therefore, a better name for this variable might be `nearestRelevantNode` or `currentNode`, indicating its role in the method.

Here's the refactored version of the method with the variable renamed:

```java
private static DetailNode getNearestNode(DetailNode node) {
    DetailNode currentNode = node;
    while (currentNode.getType() == JavadocTokenTypes.LEADING_ASTERISK
            || currentNode.getType() == JavadocTokenTypes.NEWLINE) {
        currentNode = JavadocUtil.getNextSibling(currentNode);
    }
    return currentNode;
}
```

In this refactored code, `currentNode` is used instead of `tag`, which more accurately reflects the variable's purpose of traversing and identifying the nearest relevant node in the Javadoc structure. This change makes the method easier to understand and maintain.
