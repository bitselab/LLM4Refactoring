 **Here's the refactored code with a more descriptive variable name:**

```java
private static DetailNode getNearestNonLeadingNode(DetailNode startingNode) {
    DetailNode currentNode = startingNode;
    while (currentNode.getType() == JavadocTokenTypes.LEADING_ASTERISK
            || currentNode.getType() == JavadocTokenTypes.NEWLINE) {
        currentNode = JavadocUtil.getNextSibling(currentNode);
    }
    return currentNode;
}
```

**Explanation of the changes:**

1. **Renaming the variable:** The variable `tag` has been renamed to `currentNode`. This name more accurately reflects its purpose, which is to hold a reference to the current Node being examined within the loop.

2. **Renaming the method:** The method `getNearestNode` has been renamed to `getNearestNonLeadingNode`. This name provides a more explicit description of its functionality, indicating that it finds the nearest Node that is not a leading asterisk or newline.

**Benefits of these changes:**

- **Improved readability:** The refactored code is more readable and understandable because the variable and method names clearly convey their intent.
- **Reduced cognitive load:** Readers can more easily grasp the logic of the code without having to mentally map ambiguous names to their meanings.
- **Enhanced maintainability:** Clearer names make it easier for developers to modify and debug the code in the future.

**Additional considerations for refactoring:**

- **Consistency:** Ensure that variable and method names used within a project adhere to consistent naming conventions.
- **Conciseness:** Choose names that are descriptive yet concise to avoid unnecessarily lengthy code.
- **Context:** Consider the surrounding code and the domain of the application when selecting names to ensure they are meaningful within those contexts.
