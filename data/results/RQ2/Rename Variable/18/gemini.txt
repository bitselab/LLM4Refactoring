 **Here's the refactored code with the improved variable name:**

```java
public SolrDocumentList getHistory(long since, AtomicBoolean found) {
  if (history == null) {
    return null;
  }

  SolrDocumentList docs = new SolrDocumentList();
  Iterator<SolrDocument> iter = history.iterator();
  while (iter.hasNext()) {
    SolrDocument currentEvent = iter.next();  // Renamed e to currentEvent
    long ts = ((Date) currentEvent.getFirstValue("time")).getTime();
    if (ts == since) {
      if (found != null) {
        found.set(true);
      }
    }
    if (ts > since) {
      docs.add(currentEvent);
    }
  }
  docs.setNumFound(docs.size()); // make it not look too funny
  return docs;
}
```

**Changes made:**

- The variable name `e` is renamed to `currentEvent`. This better reflects the purpose of the variable, which is to hold the current SolrDocument representing a logging event in the iteration.
- The new name aligns with the Java naming convention of using camelCase for variable names and makes the code more self-explanatory.

**This refactoring improves code readability and maintainability by using a more descriptive variable name.** This makes it easier for developers to understand the code's logic and purpose.
