 **Here's the refactored code with a more descriptive variable name for `r`:**

```java
public static void readFully(final InputStream fd, final byte[] dst,
                             int off, int len) throws IOException {
    int bytesRead = fd.readNBytes(dst, off, len);
    if (bytesRead != len) {
        throw new EOFException(JGitText.get().shortReadOfBlock);
    }
}
```

**Explanation of the change:**

- The variable `r` has been renamed to `bytesRead`. This name more clearly conveys the purpose of the variable, which is to store the number of bytes actually read from the input stream.

**Benefits of the change:**

- **Improved readability:** The code is easier to understand because the variable name explicitly states its meaning.
- **Enhanced maintainability:** The code becomes more self-documenting, making it easier for future developers to understand and modify.
- **Potential for better debugging:** If errors occur related to reading data from the stream, it's clearer to see where the problem might lie because the variable name is more informative.

**Additional refactoring considerations:**

- While this specific refactoring focused on a single variable, consider exploring other refactoring opportunities within the code to further improve its structure and maintainability.
- Regularly employing refactoring techniques helps keep code clean, readable, and adaptable to future changes.
