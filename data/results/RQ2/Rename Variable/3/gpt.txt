Refactoring the given Java code snippet involves improving the clarity and readability of variable names. The variable name `list` in the `testListIsNonModifiable` method is somewhat misleading because it actually holds a `DiffResult<SimpleClass>` object, not a list. A more appropriate name could be `diffResult`, which accurately reflects the type and purpose of the variable.

Here is the refactored code with the improved variable name:

```java
package org.apache.commons.lang3.builder;

// ... (imports remain unchanged)

public class DiffResultTest extends AbstractLangTest {
    // ... (other class members remain unchanged)

    @Test
    public void testListIsNonModifiable() {
        final SimpleClass lhs = new SimpleClass(true);
        final SimpleClass rhs = new SimpleClass(false);

        final List<Diff<?>> diffs = lhs.diff(rhs).getDiffs();

        final DiffResult<SimpleClass> diffResult = new DiffResult<>(lhs, rhs, diffs, SHORT_STYLE, DiffBuilder.TO_STRING_FORMAT);
        assertEquals(diffs, diffResult.getDiffs());
        assertEquals(1, diffResult.getNumberOfDiffs());
        assertThrows(UnsupportedOperationException.class, () -> diffResult.getDiffs().remove(0));
    }

    // ... (other methods remain unchanged)
}
```

This change makes the code more understandable by ensuring the variable name accurately describes the data it holds.
