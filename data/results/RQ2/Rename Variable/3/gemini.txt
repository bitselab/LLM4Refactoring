 **Here's the refactored code with a more descriptive variable name:**

```java
public void testDiffResultIsNonModifiable() {
  final SimpleClass lhs = new SimpleClass(true);
  final SimpleClass rhs = new SimpleClass(false);

  final List<Diff<?>> diffs = lhs.diff(rhs).getDiffs();

  final DiffResult<SimpleClass> diffResult = new DiffResult<>(lhs, rhs, diffs, SHORT_STYLE, DiffBuilder.TO_STRING_FORMAT);
  assertEquals(diffs, diffResult.getDiffs());
  assertEquals(1, diffResult.getNumberOfDiffs());
  assertThrows(UnsupportedOperationException.class, () -> diffResult.getDiffs().remove(0));
}
```

**Explanation of the change:**

- The variable `list` has been renamed to `diffResult`. This new name more accurately reflects the purpose of the variable, as it holds the result of a diff operation, not just a generic list.

**Benefits of this refactoring:**

- **Improved readability:** The code is easier to understand because the variable name clearly conveys its meaning.
- **Enhanced maintainability:** It's simpler for other developers (and your future self) to grasp the code's intent, making it easier to modify and maintain.
- **Potential for better code analysis:** Refactoring tools can often work more effectively when variable names are meaningful, potentially leading to better suggestions and insights.
