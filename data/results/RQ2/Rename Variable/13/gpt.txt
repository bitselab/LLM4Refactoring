To improve readability in the provided code snippet, we can refactor the variable name `clazz` in the `getJavaClass()` method. The name `clazz` is a common workaround in Java to avoid the reserved keyword `class`, but it can be less intuitive for those unfamiliar with this convention. A more descriptive name like `loadedClass` would better convey the purpose of this variable, which is to hold the class loaded either directly or via the specified class loader.

Here's the refactored `getJavaClass()` method:

```java
public Class<?> getJavaClass() {
    if (this.javaClass == null) {
        Try<Class<?>> loadedClass = this.classLoader == null
                ? ReflectionUtils.tryToLoadClass(this.className)
                : ReflectionUtils.tryToLoadClass(this.className, this.classLoader);
        this.javaClass = loadedClass.getOrThrow(cause ->
                new PreconditionViolationException("Could not load class with name: " + this.className, cause));
    }
    return this.javaClass;
}
```

In this refactored version, `loadedClass` clearly indicates that this variable represents the class that has been loaded, enhancing code readability and maintainability.
