In the provided code snippet from the `AspectJExpressionPointcut` class, the variable `mi` within the `matches` method is a good candidate for renaming to improve readability. The name `mi` is somewhat cryptic and does not immediately convey its purpose or type. A more descriptive name would enhance the readability and maintainability of the code.

Let's rename `mi` to `currentMethodInvocation` to more accurately describe what it represents:

```java
public boolean matches(Method method, Class<?> targetClass, Object... args) {
    obtainPointcutExpression();
    ShadowMatch shadowMatch = getTargetShadowMatch(method, targetClass);

    ProxyMethodInvocation pmi = null;
    Object targetObject = null;
    Object thisObject = null;
    try {
        MethodInvocation currentMethodInvocation = ExposeInvocationInterceptor.currentInvocation();
        if (currentMethodInvocation.getMethod() == method) {
            targetObject = currentMethodInvocation.getThis();
            if (!(currentMethodInvocation instanceof ProxyMethodInvocation currPmi)) {
                throw new IllegalStateException("MethodInvocation is not a Spring ProxyMethodInvocation: " + currentMethodInvocation);
            }
            pmi = currPmi;
            thisObject = pmi.getProxy();
        }
    }
    catch (IllegalStateException ex) {
        if (logger.isDebugEnabled()) {
            logger.debug("Could not access current invocation - matching with limited context: " + ex);
        }
    }

    try {
        JoinPointMatch joinPointMatch = shadowMatch.matchesJoinPoint(thisObject, targetObject, args);

        if (pmi != null && thisObject != null) {
            RuntimeTestWalker originalMethodResidueTest = getRuntimeTestWalker(getShadowMatch(method, method));
            if (!originalMethodResidueTest.testThisInstanceOfResidue(thisObject.getClass())) {
                return false;
            }
            if (joinPointMatch.matches()) {
                bindParameters(pmi, joinPointMatch);
            }
        }

        return joinPointMatch.matches();
    }
    catch (Throwable ex) {
        if (logger.isDebugEnabled()) {
            logger.debug("Failed to evaluate join point for arguments " + Arrays.toString(args) +
                    " - falling back to non-match", ex);
        }
        return false;
    }
}
```

This change makes it immediately clear that the variable represents a `MethodInvocation` instance. Such meaningful naming is particularly helpful for maintainability and for other developers who might work on this code in the future.
