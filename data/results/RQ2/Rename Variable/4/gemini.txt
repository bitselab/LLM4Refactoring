Here's the refactored code with a more descriptive variable name:

```java
protected Response putTransform(String id, String config, boolean deferValidation, RequestOptions options) throws IOException {
  if (createdTransformIds.contains(id)) {
    throw new IllegalArgumentException("transform [" + id + "] is already registered");
  }

  // Renamed variable put to putRequest for better readability
  Request putRequest = new Request("PUT", TRANSFORM_ENDPOINT + id);
  putRequest.setJsonEntity(config);
  if (deferValidation) {
    putRequest.addParameter("defer_validation", "true");
  }
  putRequest.setOptions(options);
  Response response = assertOK(client().performRequest(putRequest));
  createdTransformIds.add(id);
  return response;
}
```

**Explanation:**

- The variable `put` has been renamed to `putRequest`. This new name more accurately reflects the purpose of the variable, as it holds a request object for performing a PUT operation.

**Benefits of this refactoring:**

- **Improved readability:** The code is easier to understand because the variable name clearly conveys its meaning.
- **Enhanced maintainability:** It's simpler for other developers (and your future self) to grasp the code's intent, making it easier to modify and maintain.
