 **Here's the refactored code with the improved variable name:**

```java
@Bean
@ConditionalOnMissingBean
@ConditionalOnProperty(prefix = "spring.batch.job", name = "enabled", havingValue = "true", matchIfMissing = true)
public JobLauncherApplicationRunner jobLauncherApplicationRunner(JobLauncher jobLauncher, JobExplorer jobExplorer,
        JobRepository jobRepository, BatchProperties properties) {
    JobLauncherApplicationRunner runner = new JobLauncherApplicationRunner(jobLauncher, jobExplorer, jobRepository);
    String designatedJobName = properties.getJob().getName();  // Renamed jobNames to designatedJobName
    if (StringUtils.hasText(designatedJobName)) {
        runner.setJobName(designatedJobName);
    }
    return runner;
}
```

**Changes made:**

- The variable name `jobNames` is renamed to `designatedJobName`. This better reflects the purpose of the variable, which is to hold the specific job name to be executed on startup, as specified in the configuration.
- The new name clarifies the intent of the variable and improves code readability.

**This refactoring enhances code clarity by using a more meaningful variable name.** It makes it easier for developers to understand the code's logic and purpose, promoting better maintainability.
