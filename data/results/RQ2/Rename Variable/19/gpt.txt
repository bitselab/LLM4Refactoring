In the provided code snippet, the variable `jobNames` in the `jobLauncherApplicationRunner` method is misleading because it suggests that it may contain multiple job names. However, based on the context, it seems to hold only a single job name. Therefore, renaming it to `jobName` would improve readability and accurately reflect its purpose. 

Here is the refactored method with the variable renamed:

```java
@Bean
@ConditionalOnMissingBean
@ConditionalOnProperty(prefix = "spring.batch.job", name = "enabled", havingValue = "true", matchIfMissing = true)
public JobLauncherApplicationRunner jobLauncherApplicationRunner(JobLauncher jobLauncher, JobExplorer jobExplorer,
                                                                 JobRepository jobRepository, BatchProperties properties) {
    JobLauncherApplicationRunner runner = new JobLauncherApplicationRunner(jobLauncher, jobExplorer, jobRepository);
    String jobName = properties.getJob().getName();  // Renamed variable jobNames to jobName
    if (StringUtils.hasText(jobName)) {
        runner.setJobName(jobName);
    }
    return runner;
}
```

This change enhances the clarity of the code by making it more apparent that the variable holds a single job name. It is a minor but significant improvement in terms of code readability and maintainability.
