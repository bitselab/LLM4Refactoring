 **Here's the refactored code with the renamed variable:**

```java
public static List<StateMetadata> getMultiInputOperatorDefaultMeta(
        Map<Integer, Long> stateTtlFromHint,
        ReadableConfig tableConfig,
        String... stateNameList) {
    Duration defaultStateTtl = tableConfig.get(ExecutionConfigOptions.IDLE_STATE_RETENTION);
    List<StateMetadata> stateMetadataList = new ArrayList<>(stateNameList.length);
    for (int i = 0; i < stateNameList.length; i++) {
        Duration stateTtl =
                stateTtlFromHint.containsKey(i)
                        ? Duration.ofMillis(stateTtlFromHint.get(i))
                        : defaultStateTtl;
        stateMetadataList.add(new StateMetadata(i, stateTtl, stateNameList[i]));
    }
    return stateMetadataList;
}
```

**Explanation of the change:**

- The variable `stateRetentionTime` has been renamed to `defaultStateTtl`.
- This new name better reflects its purpose, which is to hold the default state time-to-live value that's used if a specific TTL is not provided via hints.

**Benefits of this refactoring:**

- **Improved readability:** The code is easier to understand because the variable name now clearly conveys its meaning.
- **Enhanced consistency:** The naming aligns more closely with other parts of the code, where `stateTtl` is used to refer to state time-to-live values.
- **Potential maintainability:** Clearer variable names can make the code easier to maintain and modify in the future.
