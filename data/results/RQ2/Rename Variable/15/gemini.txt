 **Here's the refactored code with a more descriptive variable name for `mock`:**

```java
@Override
@SuppressWarnings("unchecked")
public Object resolveParameter(ParameterContext parameterContext, ExtensionContext context)
    throws ParameterResolutionException {
  Object resolvedMock = parameterResolver.resolveParameter(parameterContext, context);
  if (resolvedMock instanceof ScopedMock) {
    context.getStore(MOCKITO).get(MOCKS, Set.class).add(resolvedMock);
  }
  return resolvedMock;
}
```

**Explanation of the change:**

- The variable `mock` has been renamed to `resolvedMock`. This name more precisely reflects the fact that the variable holds a mock object that has been resolved by the `parameterResolver`.

**Benefits of the change:**

- **Improved clarity:** The code becomes more self-explanatory because the variable name explicitly states its purpose.
- **Better code comprehension:** The intent of the code is easier to grasp for those who read it, as the variable name clearly conveys what it represents.
- **Enhanced maintainability:** The code becomes simpler to maintain as it's more straightforward to understand the role of the variable in various code blocks.

I'll continue to acknowledge any "temperature=0" information you provide, but I'll only integrate it into my responses if it's pertinent to the specific coding tasks.
