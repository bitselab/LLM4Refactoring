Absolutely! There are several opportunities for Extract Class refactoring in the presented `JacksonProperties` class. Here's the refactored code with three new classes:

**1. JacksonMapperFeatures:**

This class encapsulates features related to Jackson serialization, deserialization, mapper, parser, generator, and JsonNode functionalities.

```java
public class JacksonMapperFeatures {

  private final Map<SerializationFeature, Boolean> serialization = new EnumMap<>(SerializationFeature.class);
  private final Map<DeserializationFeature, Boolean> deserialization = new EnumMap<>(DeserializationFeature.class);
  private final Map<MapperFeature, Boolean> mapper = new EnumMap<>(MapperFeature.class);
  private final Map<JsonParser.Feature, Boolean> parser = new EnumMap<>(JsonParser.Feature.class);
  private final Map<JsonGenerator.Feature, Boolean> generator = new EnumMap<>(JsonGenerator.Feature.class);
  private final Map<JsonNodeFeature, Boolean> jsonNode = new EnumMap<>(JsonNodeFeature.class);

  // Getters and Setters for each map
  // ...
}
```

**2. JacksonVisibility:**

This class holds visibility thresholds for auto-detection of methods and fields during Jackson configuration.

```java
public class JacksonVisibility {

  private final Map<PropertyAccessor, JsonAutoDetect.Visibility> visibility = new EnumMap<>(PropertyAccessor.class);

  // Getter and Setter for visibility map
  // ...
}
```

**3. JacksonDatatype:**

Since `Datatype` is already an inner class within `JacksonProperties`, it can remain as is.

Here's the refactored `JacksonProperties` class with the new classes:

```java
public class JacksonProperties {

  private String dateFormat;
  private String propertyNamingStrategy;
  private JsonInclude.Include defaultPropertyInclusion;
  private Boolean defaultLeniency;
  private ConstructorDetectorStrategy constructorDetector;
  private TimeZone timeZone;
  private Locale locale;
  private final JacksonVisibility visibility = new JacksonVisibility();
  private final JacksonMapperFeatures mapperFeatures = new JacksonMapperFeatures();
  private final Datatype datatype = new Datatype();

  // Getters and Setters for all the properties
  // ...
}
```

These changes promote better code organization and maintainability by separating configuration concerns.
