## No Refactoring Necessary  

The provided code snippet for `JacksonProperties` appears well-structured and adheres to good practices. Here's why refactoring isn't currently necessary:

* **Clear Separation of Concerns:** The class properties are grouped logically using separate maps for different Jackson configuration aspects (serialization, deserialization, etc.).
* **Descriptive Names:**  Variable and property names are descriptive, improving code readability.
* **Immutable Datatype:** The `Datatype` inner class seems well-suited as a separate data holder for date-related configurations.
* **Getter and Setter Methods:**  Standard getter and setter methods are used for property access, following common Java conventions.

Overall, the code maintains a clean and maintainable structure.

However, there are a few minor considerations for potential future improvements:

* **Optional for `dateFormat` and `propertyNamingStrategy`**:  Since these properties might be null, consider using `Optional<String>` instead of `String` to indicate their potential absence.
* **Javadoc Comments**: While not strictly necessary for functionality, adding Javadoc comments to methods and classes can further enhance code clarity.

These are minor suggestions, and the current implementation is well-written without requiring immediate refactoring.
