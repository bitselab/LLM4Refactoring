Reviewing the provided code snippet from the `TestTermsHashPerField` class in the `org.apache.lucene.index` package, we can identify opportunities for the Extract Class refactoring. This approach is beneficial for reducing the complexity of a class by moving some of its responsibilities into a new class. Let's analyze potential refactorings:

1. **Posting Management**: The inner `Posting` class, along with the logic to manage postings (found in the `testAddAndUpdateRandom` method), can be extracted into a separate class. This class would handle the creation, management, and updating of postings.

2. **Reader Validation**: The `assertDocAndFreq` method is a candidate to be moved to a new class, potentially named `DocFreqValidator`, which would encapsulate the logic for validating document frequencies.

3. **Random Data Generation**: The functionality for generating random data in the `testWriteBytes` and `testAllocKnownSizeSlice` methods can be extracted into a utility class, which could be named `RandomDataGenerator`.

Here's an example of how the refactoring might look for the first point:

### Original Code Inside `TestTermsHashPerField`:

```java
// Inside testAddAndUpdateRandom
class Posting {
    int termId = -1;
    final TreeMap<Integer, Integer> docAndFreq = new TreeMap<>();
}
Map<BytesRef, Posting> postingMap = new HashMap<>();
// Logic for populating and using postingMap...
```

### Refactored Code:

#### New Class: PostingManager.java

```java
package org.apache.lucene.index;

import org.apache.lucene.util.BytesRef;

import java.util.HashMap;
import java.util.Map;
import java.util.TreeMap;

public class PostingManager {
    private Map<BytesRef, Posting> postingMap = new HashMap<>();

    private class Posting {
        int termId = -1;
        final TreeMap<Integer, Integer> docAndFreq = new TreeMap<>();
    }

    public void createOrUpdatePosting(BytesRef ref, int doc, int termOrd) {
        Posting posting = postingMap.computeIfAbsent(ref, k -> new Posting());
        if (posting.termId == -1) {
            posting.termId = termOrd;
        }
        posting.docAndFreq.putIfAbsent(doc, 0);
        posting.docAndFreq.compute(doc, (key, oldVal) -> oldVal + 1);
    }

    public Map<BytesRef, Posting> getPostings() {
        return postingMap;
    }
}
```

#### Updated `TestTermsHashPerField`:

```java
// Use PostingManager in testAddAndUpdateRandom method
PostingManager postingManager = new PostingManager();
// ... rest of the code
```

In the refactored example, the responsibilities related to posting management are moved to a separate `PostingManager` class, simplifying the `TestTermsHashPerField` class and making the code more maintainable.

The same approach can be applied to the other two points identified, creating separate classes for reader validation and random data generation. 

Please note, to complete this refactoring, you would need to make corresponding adjustments in the `TestTermsHashPerField` class to integrate with these new classes. Also, thorough testing is necessary to ensure that the refactoring does not introduce any regressions.
