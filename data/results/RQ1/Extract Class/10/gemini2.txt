Here are some potential extract class refactoring opportunities in the provided code:

1. **Extract a class for postings array:**
   - The `FreqProxTermsWriterPerField.FreqProxPostingsArray` class seems tightly coupled with `TermsHashPerField`. 
   - It manages the internal structure of the postings array used for storing term frequencies and document IDs.
   - Create a separate class named `PostingsArray` to encapsulate this functionality.

2. **Extract a class for term writing logic:**
   - The methods `newTerm` and `addTerm` within `TermsHashPerField` handle writing logic for new and existing terms, respectively.
   - These methods could be refactored into a dedicated class named `TermWriter` to improve code organization and potential reuse. 

3. **Extract a class for byte reading logic:**
   - The `assertDocAndFreq` method is responsible for reading and interpreting term frequencies and document IDs from the byte slice reader.
   - Encapsulating this logic in a separate class named `ByteReader` would promote better separation of concerns.

Here's the refactored code with these changes:

```java
package org.apache.lucene.index;

// ... other imports

public class TestTermsHashPerField extends LuceneTestCase {

  private static TermsHashPerField createNewHash(AtomicInteger newCalled, AtomicInteger addCalled) {
    IntBlockPool intBlockPool = new IntBlockPool();
    ByteBlockPool byteBlockPool = new ByteBlockPool(new ByteBlockPool.DirectAllocator());
    TermBlockPool termBlockPool = new TermBlockPool(new ByteBlockPool.DirectAllocator());

    TermsHashPerField hash = new TermsHashPerField(
        1,
        intBlockPool,
        byteBlockPool,
        termBlockPool,
        Counter.newCounter(),
        null,
        "testfield",
        IndexOptions.DOCS_AND_FREQS
    );
    return hash;
  }

  boolean assertDocAndFreq(ByteSliceReader reader, PostingsArray postingsArray, int prevDoc, int termId, int doc, int frequency) throws IOException {
    // ... (delegate reading logic to ByteReader)
  }

  public void testAddAndUpdateTerm() throws IOException {
    // ... (use TermWriter for writing logic)
  }

  public static class TermsHashPerField {
    private final PostingsArray postingsArray;
    private final TermWriter termWriter;

    // ... other fields and methods

    void newTerm(int termID, int docID) {
      termWriter.newTerm(termID, docID);
    }

    void addTerm(int termID, int docID) {
      termWriter.addTerm(termID, docID);
    }

    // ... other methods
  }

  public static class PostingsArray {
    // ... fields representing the postings array structure
  }

  public static class TermWriter {
    private final TermsHashPerField hash;

    public TermWriter(TermsHashPerField hash) {
      this.hash = hash;
    }

    void newTerm(int termID, int docID) {
      // ... writing logic for new terms
    }

    void addTerm(int termID, int docID) {
      // ... writing logic for existing terms
    }
  }

  public static class ByteReader {
    // ... methods for reading byte slices and interpreting data
  }
}
```

These refactorings improve code maintainability and readability by separating functionalities into focused classes. They also promote potential code reuse if the extracted functionalities are applicable in other contexts.
