No major refactoring is necessary for the provided code snippet from `DomainSplitFunction`. Here's a breakdown of why the code appears well-structured:

1. **Modular Functions:** The logic is divided into well-defined functions like `splitDomain`, `findPublicSuffix`, and `topPrivateDomain`, improving readability and maintainability.
2. **Meaningful Variable Names:** Variable names like `publicSuffixIndex` and `highestRegistered` clearly convey their purpose.
3. **Comments:** Comments explain complex logic sections, enhancing understanding.
4. **Proper Exception Handling:** The code uses `UncheckedIOException` for checked exceptions from `Streams.readAllLines`, improving code flow.

There are a few minor suggestions for improvement:

1. **Redundant String Replacement:** The `replaceDots` function can be potentially simplified by using a regular expression to replace all fullwidth and halfwidth dot characters in a single pass.
2. **Consider Alternative for `ConstantHolder`:** If `ConstantHolder` is a simple class holding the static maps, it could be replaced with directly referencing the static maps within the class for better clarity.
3. **Early Return for Invalid Input:** In `domainSplit`, if `host` contains a colon (":"), it can directly return an empty list instead of further processing.

Overall, the code demonstrates good practices for writing clear and maintainable functions.
