## Refactoring Opportunities

This code snippet has several opportunities for refactoring to improve readability and maintainability. Here are the suggested changes:

**1. Remove HTML from Javadoc:**

Javadoc comments are meant to describe the code functionality, not for including formatted text. Remove all HTML tags and styling from the comments.

**2. Use Preformatted Text for Code Examples:**

If you need to include code examples within Javadoc comments, use the `<code>` tag to format them as preformatted text. This preserves the formatting of the code snippet.

**3. Consider Alternative Documentation Tools:**

For more complex documentation needs, consider using dedicated documentation tools like Javadoc with extensions or tools like Markdown with code highlighting capabilities. These tools provide a better separation of concerns between code and documentation.

## Refactored Code (Example):

Here's an example of the refactored code with the first suggestion implemented:

```java
package com.puppycrawl.tools.checkstyle.checks.javadoc.abstractjavadoc;

/**
 * This class is only meant for testing.
 * 
 * Note: In HTML, closing all tags is not necessary, neither is opening every tag.
 * 
 * @see https://www.w3.org/TR/html51/syntax.html#optional-start-and-end-tags
 */
public class InputAbstractJavadocNonTightHtmlTags2 {

  /** 
   * paraception (multiple p tags)
   */
  private int field1;

  /**
   * List should be opened (unclosed li tag)
   */
  private int field2;

  /**
   * Paragraph is closed and would be nested (unclosed p tag within li)
   */
  private int field3;

  /**
   * Complete p nesting (unclosed tr tag and p tag within li)
   */
  private int field4;

  /**
   * Paragraph with anchor tag, nested paragraph with singleton tag, outer list not nested (unclosed li tags)
   */
  private int field5;

  // ... (rest of the code remains the same)
}
```

This is just a basic example. You can further improve the comments by adding more descriptive text about the functionality of each field and method.
