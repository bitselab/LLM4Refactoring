The provided code snippet appears to be a complex class that mixes multiple responsibilities, such as managing various fields and handling HTML tag processing within Javadoc comments. An "Extract Class" refactoring is suitable here to improve readability and maintainability. This involves separating the concerns into different classes. Here's a refactoring strategy:

1. **HTML Tag Processing**: The comments and violations related to HTML tag processing suggest a separate responsibility that could be extracted into its own class. This new class would handle the validation and formatting of HTML tags within Javadoc comments.

2. **Field Management**: The class manages several fields (field1, field2, etc.) with getters and setters. These could be refactored into separate classes if they represent different concerns or data types.

Based on these observations, I'll refactor the code by creating a new class for HTML tag processing and reorganizing the existing class to focus solely on field management. Let's proceed with the refactoring:

```java
package com.puppycrawl.tools.checkstyle.checks.javadoc.abstractjavadoc;

/**
 * This class is responsible for managing fields and their accessors.
 */
public class FieldManager {
    private int field1;
    private int field2;
    private int field3;
    private int field4;
    private int field5;

    // Getters and setters for each field
    int getField1() { return field1; }
    void setField1(int field1) { this.field1 = field1; }

    int getField2() { return field2; }
    void setField2(int field2) { this.field2 = field2; }

    int getField3() { return field3; }
    void setField3(int field3) { this.field3 = field3; }

    int getField4() { return field4; }
    void setField4(int field4) { this.field4 = field4; }

    int getField5() { return field5; }
    void setField5(int field5) { this.field5 = field5; }
}

/**
 * This class is responsible for HTML tag processing within Javadoc comments.
 */
class HtmlTagProcessor {
    // Methods for validating and formatting HTML tags
    // These methods would contain the logic for handling HTML tags in Javadoc comments
    // Example method signatures (actual implementation would depend on specific requirements):
    boolean isValidTag(String tag) {
        // Implementation
    }

    String formatTagForJavadoc(String tag) {
        // Implementation
    }
}
```

In this refactored code:

- The `FieldManager` class now focuses solely on managing fields and their accessors, improving its single responsibility and readability.
- The `HtmlTagProcessor` class is introduced to handle HTML tag processing within Javadoc comments, separating this concern from the field management.
- Actual implementations for `isValidTag` and `formatTagForJavadoc` in `HtmlTagProcessor` would depend on the specific logic needed for handling HTML tags. 

This refactoring results in cleaner, more maintainable code with separated concerns.
