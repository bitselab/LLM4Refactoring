## Refactoring Opportunities in TermsHashPerField

Here are some refactoring opportunities in the provided `TermsHashPerField` code:

1. **Extract method for writing a single byte:** 
Currently, the `writeByte` method performs multiple checks and updates before writing a single byte to the pool. This logic can be extracted into a separate helper method named `writeToPool` that takes the byte value and offset as arguments. This improves code readability and reusability.

2. **Simplify logic for allocating slices:** 
The `allocSlice` and `allocKnownSizeSlice` methods handle allocating new slices based on size and level. This logic can be potentially simplified by creating a single method that takes the desired slice size and level as arguments and returns the new slice's offset in the pool.

3. **Extract constant declarations:** 
Several constants like `FIRST_LEVEL_SIZE`, `NEXT_LEVEL_ARRAY`, and `LEVEL_SIZE_ARRAY` are used throughout the code. These constants can be grouped and declared at the beginning of the class for better organization.

4. **Use descriptive variable names:** 
Some variable names like `upto` are not very descriptive. Consider using more meaningful names like `currentOffset` or `sliceLength` to improve code clarity.

## Refactored Code

```java
abstract class TermsHashPerField implements Comparable<TermsHashPerField> {
  // ... existing class members ...

  private static final int[] LEVEL_SIZE_ARRAY = {5, 14, 20, 30, 40, 40, 80, 80, 120, 200};
  private static final int[] NEXT_LEVEL_ARRAY = {1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 9};
  private static final int FIRST_LEVEL_SIZE = LEVEL_SIZE_ARRAY[0];

  private void writeToPool(byte b, int offset) {
    byte[] bytes = bytePool.getBuffer(offset >> ByteBlockPool.BYTE_BLOCK_SHIFT);
    assert bytes != null;
    bytes[offset & ByteBlockPool.BYTE_BLOCK_MASK] = b;
  }

  private int allocateSlice(int size, int level) {
    if (size > ByteBlockPool.BYTE_BLOCK_SIZE) {
      throw new IllegalArgumentException("Slice size " + size + " exceeds block size");
    }
    if (pool.byteUpto > ByteBlockPool.BYTE_BLOCK_SIZE - size) {
      pool.nextBuffer();
    }
    int newUpto = pool.byteUpto;
    pool.byteUpto += size;
    pool.buffer[pool.byteUpto - 1] = (byte) (16 | level); // level 0 encoded
    return newUpto;
  }

  // ... remaining methods of TermsHashPerField ...
}
```

These are just some suggestions for improvement.  Depending on the specific coding standards and preferences, additional refactoring opportunities might exist.
