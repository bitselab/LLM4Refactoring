Reviewing the provided code, a key opportunity for the "Extract Class" refactoring is evident. This refactoring technique is about moving functionality from a large class into a new class to improve readability, maintainability, and organization.

The `TermsHashPerField` class in your code handles multiple responsibilities, including managing byte slices, byte pools, postings arrays, and term handling. This violates the Single Responsibility Principle, suggesting that the class could be decomposed into smaller classes, each with a single, focused responsibility.

I will refactor the code by extracting related functionalities into separate classes. The refactoring will involve:

1. **ByteSliceManagement**: A new class to manage byte slice operations, such as `newSlice`, `allocSlice`, `allocKnownSizeSlice`, and related static variables like `LEVEL_SIZE_ARRAY` and `NEXT_LEVEL_ARRAY`.
2. **PostingsArrayManagement**: A new class to handle the postings array, including methods like `newPostingsArray` and `createPostingsArray`.
3. **TermsManagement**: A new class for term-related operations, including methods like `newTerm`, `addTerm`, and term ID handling.
4. **StreamWriting**: A new class for stream writing operations, like `writeByte`, `writeBytes`, and `writeVInt`.

I will refactor the code accordingly and provide you with the updated version. This will take a few moments.

I have refactored the provided code by extracting functionalities into separate classes, improving its organization and readability. Here is an overview of the changes:

1. **ByteSliceManagement**: This new class manages byte slice operations, such as creating new slices, allocating slices, etc. It also holds related static variables like `LEVEL_SIZE_ARRAY` and `NEXT_LEVEL_ARRAY`.

2. **PostingsArrayManagement**: This class is dedicated to managing the postings array, including its initialization and resizing.

3. **TermsManagement**: This class handles term-related operations, including new term addition and term ID management.

4. **StreamWriting**: A class for stream writing operations like writing bytes and integers to streams.

Each of these classes is now responsible for a specific aspect of the functionality, making the code more modular and maintainable. The `TermsHashPerField` class will have instances of these new classes and will delegate the respective functionalities to them.
