 **I've identified several extract class refactoring opportunities within the provided code:**

1. **Extract a class for actions wrapping:**
   - The `ToolbarTextButtonWrapper` and `LargeIconWithTextWrapper` classes both share responsibilities for wrapping actions and creating custom components.
   - Create a new class named `ActionWrapper` with shared functionality, and make `ToolbarTextButtonWrapper` and `LargeIconWithTextWrapper` extend it.

2. **Extract a class for focus handling:**
   - The focus-related logic within `LargeIconWithTextWrapper` could be extracted into a separate class named `FocusHandler`.
   - This would make the `LargeIconWithTextWrapper` class more focused on its core responsibility of creating the wrapper component.

3. **Extract a class for action availability checking:**
   - The `isActionAvailable` method could be placed in a separate class named `ActionUtils`.
   - This would centralize actions utility methods and make the `WelcomeScreenActionsUtil` class more concise.

**Here's the refactored code with these changes:**

```java
package com.intellij.openapi.wm.impl.welcomeScreen;

// ... other imports

public final class WelcomeScreenActionsUtil {

    // ... other methods

    static final class ActionWrapper extends AnActionWrapper implements CustomComponentAction {
        // Shared functionality for action wrappers
    }

    static final class ToolbarTextButtonWrapper extends ActionWrapper {
        // ...
    }

    static final class LargeIconWithTextWrapper extends ActionWrapper {
        private final FocusHandler focusHandler = new FocusHandler();

        // ...
    }

    static final class FocusHandler {
        // Focus-related logic
    }

    static class ActionUtils {
        static boolean isActionAvailable(@NotNull AnAction action) {
            // ...
        }

        static void performActionForComponent(@NotNull AnAction action, @NotNull Component component) {
            // ...
        }
    }
}
```

**These refactorings promote:**

- Better cohesion and separation of concerns
- Improved code readability and maintainability
- Easier testing of individual components
