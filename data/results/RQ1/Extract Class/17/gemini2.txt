There is a potential refactoring opportunity in this code using the Extract Class technique. The static method `tokenize(Tokenizer tokenizer, TextDocument textDocument, Tokens tokens)` can be extracted into a separate class. 

Here's the refactored code:

```java
package net.sourceforge.pmd.cpd;

import java.io.IOException;

import net.sourceforge.pmd.lang.document.TextDocument;

/**
 * Tokenizes a source file into tokens consumable by CPD.
 */
public interface Tokenizer {

  public static final PropertyDescriptor<Boolean> CPD_IGNORE_LITERAL_SEQUENCES =
      PropertyFactory.booleanProperty("cpdIgnoreLiteralSequences")
          .defaultValue(false)
          .desc("Ignore sequences of literals, eg `0, 0, 0, 0`")
          .build();
  // ... other constants omitted for brevity ...

  /**
   * Tokenizes the source code and record tokens using the provided token factory.
   */
  void tokenize(TextDocument document, TokenFactory tokens) throws IOException;

  /**
   * A helper class to encapsulate tokenization logic with proper resource management.
   */
  static class TokenizerUtil {

    /**
     * Wraps a call to {@link #tokenize(TextDocument, TokenFactory)} to properly
     * create and close the token factory.
     */
    public static void tokenize(Tokenizer tokenizer, TextDocument textDocument, Tokens tokens) throws IOException {
      try (TokenFactory tf = Tokens.factoryForFile(textDocument, tokens)) {
        tokenizer.tokenize(textDocument, tf);
      }
    }
  }
}
```

We've created a new static inner class named `TokenizerUtil` within the `Tokenizer` interface. This class holds the extracted method `tokenize`. This improves the code's organization by separating concerns and promoting better encapsulation. 

Here's why this is a good refactoring:

- Improves readability: By separating the logic into a dedicated class, the code becomes easier to understand and follow.
- Encapsulation: The `TokenizerUtil` class encapsulates the resource management logic related to `TokenFactory`.
- Reusability: If this functionality is needed elsewhere, the `TokenizerUtil.tokenize` method can be reused without duplicating code.

It's important to note that using a static inner class keeps the new class closely associated with the `Tokenizer` interface. If this functionality becomes more complex or needs to be used independently in the future, it might be better to create a separate top-level class.
