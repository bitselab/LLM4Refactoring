The provided code snippet appears to be well-structured and follows best practices. There are no obvious refactoring opportunities to be made at this time. Here's a breakdown of the code's strengths:

- **Clear separation of concerns:** The code is organized into distinct sections with clear responsibilities. For instance, the `assertReflectionRegistered` and `assertAnnotationRegistered` methods handle runtime hints verification, while the `assertContextForXXX` methods handle test context assertions for different test types (basic, web, etc.).
- **Meaningful variable names:** Variable names like `expectedSourceFiles`, `runtimeHints`, and `generatedFiles` accurately reflect their purpose, enhancing readability.
- **Comments:** Comments are included where necessary to explain specific code sections or logic, improving maintainability.
- **Test cases:** The presence of various test cases with `@ParameterizedTest` ensures thorough testing across different scenarios.

If you'd like to explore potential improvements in the future, here are some areas to consider:

- **Test data isolation:** While the current tests seem to function well, consider using a testing framework like Mockito to isolate test data and mock dependencies for better unit testing.
- **Readability of long test methods:** If some test methods become very lengthy in the future, you might break them down into smaller helper methods to improve readability.

Overall, the provided code demonstrates a well-organized and well-tested approach. No immediate refactoring is necessary.
