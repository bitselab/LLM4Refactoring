In the provided code snippet, there is no immediate need for Extract Class refactoring. The class `TestUtils` contains various utility methods that seem well-organized and focused on their respective functionalities. 

Here's why Extract Class refactoring might not be ideal in this case:

- **Cohesion:** The methods within `TestUtils` appear to be related to utility functions used for string manipulation, data manipulation, and working with Solr-specific data structures. This creates a good level of cohesion within the class.
- **Scattered Functionality:** Extracting functions wouldn't necessarily improve the overall structure as they are all focused on utility purposes.

However, there are alternative ways to improve the code:

1. **Improve method naming:** Some method names could be more descriptive (e.g., `testEscapeTextWithSeparator` could be `escapeTextForSeparator`).
2. **Reduce code duplication:** If there are any code blocks that  repeat functionality across methods, consider extracting them into separate utility methods.

Overall, the current structure seems reasonable for this set of utility methods.
