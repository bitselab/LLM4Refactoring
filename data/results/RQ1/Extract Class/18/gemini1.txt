In this case, there is no urgent need for refactoring. The code is well-structured with clear separation of concerns between the test methods and the helper methods used within them. 

However, there are a few minor improvements that could be considered:

1. **Static Imports**: You can remove unnecessary imports using static imports. For example, instead of `static java.util.Arrays.asList` you can use `static import java.util.Arrays.asList`. This can slightly improve readability.
2. **Meaningful Variable Names**: Some variable names like `m` or `o` could be made more descriptive based on their context. This can improve code clarity.

Overall, the code is well-written and maintains good practices.
