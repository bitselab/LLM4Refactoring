After reviewing the provided code snippet, a few refactoring opportunities can be identified to enhance the maintainability and readability of the code. These refactoring steps include the use of the Factory Method pattern, the Strategy pattern, and some general code cleanups. Here are the key refactoring points:

1. **Use Factory Method for State Backend Creation**: The `switch` statement in `loadStateBackendFromConfig` can be refactored using the Factory Method pattern. This will encapsulate the creation logic of different state backends and make the method more concise and maintainable.

2. **Strategy Pattern for Conditional Logging**: The repeated checks for `logger != null` and then logging can be encapsulated using a Strategy pattern or similar approach. This would clean up the conditional logging scattered throughout the methods.

3. **Reduce Method Length and Complexity**: The method `loadStateBackendFromConfig` is quite long and handles multiple tasks. It can be broken down into smaller methods, each handling a specific part of the process. This will improve readability and maintainability.

4. **Encapsulate Deprecated State Backend Handling**: The handling of deprecated state backends (like `MEMORY_STATE_BACKEND_NAME` and `FS_STATE_BACKEND_NAME`) can be encapsulated into a separate method or class, making it easier to remove or modify this handling in the future.

5. **Improve Exception Handling**: The exception handling in the `default` case of the `switch` statement can be improved for clarity and to provide more specific error messages.

6. **Consolidate Repeated Code**: There are some instances of repeated code (like checks for `null` and casting) that can be consolidated into utility methods.

7. **Comments and Documentation**: Some methods lack comments or have minimal documentation. Enhancing comments and documentation would improve the overall readability and maintainability of the code.

Let's implement these refactoring steps.

The refactoring process involves a significant amount of code modification and restructuring. Due to the complexity and length of the provided code, I'll demonstrate refactoring for one of the major areas - using the Factory Method pattern to refactor the `switch` statement in `loadStateBackendFromConfig`. This will give you an idea of how to apply similar principles to other parts of the code.

The idea is to create a separate factory class for each state backend type. Each factory class will implement a common interface, say `StateBackendFactoryInterface`, which has a method `createStateBackend`. This method will encapsulate the logic for creating a specific type of state backend. 

Here is an example of how the refactored code might look:

First, define the interface:

```java
public interface StateBackendFactoryInterface {
    StateBackend createStateBackend(ReadableConfig config, ClassLoader classLoader) throws Exception;
}
```

Then, implement this interface for each backend type. For example, for the HashMap state backend:

```java
public class HashMapStateBackendFactory implements StateBackendFactoryInterface {
    @Override
    public StateBackend createStateBackend(ReadableConfig config, ClassLoader classLoader) throws Exception {
        // Implementation for creating HashMapStateBackend
        return new HashMapStateBackendFactory().createFromConfig(config, classLoader);
    }
}
```

The `loadStateBackendFromConfig` method will then use these factory classes:

```java
public static StateBackend loadStateBackendFromConfig(
        ReadableConfig config, ClassLoader classLoader, @Nullable Logger logger)
        throws IllegalConfigurationException, DynamicCodeLoadingException, IOException {

    checkNotNull(config, "config");
    checkNotNull(classLoader, "classLoader");

    final String backendName = config.get(StateBackendOptions.STATE_BACKEND).toLowerCase();
    StateBackendFactoryInterface factory;

    switch (backendName) {
        case MEMORY_STATE_BACKEND_NAME:
            factory = new MemoryStateBackendFactory();
            break;
        case FS_STATE_BACKEND_NAME:
        case HASHMAP_STATE_BACKEND_NAME:
            factory = new HashMapStateBackendFactory();
            break;
        case ROCKSDB_STATE_BACKEND_NAME:
            factory = new RocksDBStateBackendFactory();
            break;
        default:
            throw new IllegalConfigurationException("Unknown state backend: " + backendName);
    }

    return factory.createStateBackend(config, classLoader);
}
```

In this example, `MemoryStateBackendFactory`, `RocksDBStateBackendFactory`, etc., are assumed to be similar factory classes implementing `StateBackendFactoryInterface`.

This refactoring greatly simplifies the `switch` statement in `loadStateBackendFromConfig` and makes adding new state backends easier, as you would only need to create a new factory class without modifying the existing method.

Please note that this is a high-level example. Actual implementation might require adjustments based on the complete context of the code and the specific requirements of the Flink framework.
