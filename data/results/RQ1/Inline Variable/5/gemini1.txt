 **Here are some refactoring opportunities identified in the code:**

**1. Simplify Conditional Logic:**

- In `loadStateBackendFromConfig()`, the `switch` statement could be simplified using a `Map` to associate backend names with factory classes.
- The nested conditional blocks in `loadFromApplicationOrConfigOrDefaultInternal()` could be consolidated using more concise conditional statements.

**2. Refactor Redundant Code:**

- The logging statements in `loadFromApplicationOrConfigOrDefaultInternal()` and `loadStateBackendFromConfig()` could be consolidated into a helper method for consistency.
- The exception handling in `wrapStateBackend()` and `loadStateBackendFromKeyedStateHandles()` could be streamlined using a common approach for clarity.

**3. Improve Method Naming:**

- `loadFromApplicationOrConfigOrDefaultInternal()` could be renamed to `loadCoreStateBackend()` for better clarity.
- `stateBackendFromApplicationOrConfigOrDefaultUseManagedMemory()` could be renamed to `usesManagedMemory()` for conciseness.

**4. Consider Polymorphism:**

- Instead of using conditional logic for different backend types in `loadStateBackendFromConfig()`, explore using polymorphism to create a hierarchy of StateBackend classes with varying behavior.

**5. Eliminate Reflection:**

- If possible, remove the use of reflection in `wrapStateBackend()` by directly referencing required classes. This can improve performance and maintainability.

**6. Refactor for Readability:**

- Break down long methods (e.g., `fromApplicationOrConfigOrDefault()`) into smaller, focused methods for better readability.
- Use more descriptive variable names to enhance code clarity.

**7. Address Deprecation:**

- Remove or update the deprecated backend constants (e.g., `MEMORY_STATE_BACKEND_NAME`, `FS_STATE_BACKEND_NAME`) and their associated logic for consistency and maintainability.

**Additional Considerations:**

- Introduce unit tests to ensure code correctness after refactoring.
- Explore using a design pattern like Factory or Strategy to manage StateBackend creation and configuration, potentially improving flexibility and testability.
- Consider potential performance implications of any refactoring changes.
