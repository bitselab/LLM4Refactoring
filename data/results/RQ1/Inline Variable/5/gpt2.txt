After reviewing the provided code snippet from the Apache Flink project, particularly focusing on the potential for inline variable refactoring, I have identified a few opportunities where this refactoring technique could be applied. Inline variable refactoring is generally used to improve code readability and conciseness by replacing a variable with its direct value if the variable is only used in a limited scope and does not add significant clarity.

Here are the specific changes:

1. In the `loadStateBackendFromConfig` method:
    - The variable `factoryClassName` is immediately assigned the value of `backendName` and then conditionally reassigned. Since it's used only within the scope of the switch-case block, it can be inlined for the `ROCKSDB_STATE_BACKEND_NAME` case.

2. In the `fromApplicationOrConfigOrDefault` method:
    - The variable `enableChangeLog` is used only once in a subsequent if-else block. This can be inlined within the if condition.

3. In the `stateBackendFromApplicationOrConfigOrDefaultUseManagedMemory` method:
    - The variable `fromConfig` is used only once in the return statement. It can be inlined for clarity.

I will refactor the code accordingly. Please note that these changes are primarily for readability and maintainability, and they will not affect the functionality of the code. The effectiveness and desirability of such refactorings can vary based on the team's coding style and preferences.

Here's the refactored code with the identified inline variable refactorings applied:

```java
package org.apache.flink.runtime.state;

// ... [import statements remain unchanged] ...

/** This class contains utility methods to load state backends from configurations. */
public class StateBackendLoader {

    // ... [Other members and methods remain unchanged] ...

    @Nonnull
    public static StateBackend loadStateBackendFromConfig(
            ReadableConfig config, ClassLoader classLoader, @Nullable Logger logger)
            throws IllegalConfigurationException, DynamicCodeLoadingException, IOException {

        // ... [Initial part of the method remains unchanged] ...

        switch (backendName.toLowerCase()) {
            // ... [Cases for MEMORY_STATE_BACKEND_NAME, FS_STATE_BACKEND_NAME, and HASHMAP_STATE_BACKEND_NAME remain unchanged] ...

            case ROCKSDB_STATE_BACKEND_NAME:
                // Inline the variable factoryClassName
                if (logger != null) {
                    logger.info("Loading state backend via factory {}", ROCKSDB_STATE_BACKEND_FACTORY);
                }

                // ... [Rest of the ROCKSDB_STATE_BACKEND_NAME case remains unchanged] ...

            default:
                // ... [Default case remains unchanged] ...
        }
    }

    public static StateBackend fromApplicationOrConfigOrDefault(
            @Nullable StateBackend fromApplication,
            TernaryBoolean isChangelogStateBackendEnableFromApplication,
            Configuration config,
            ClassLoader classLoader,
            @Nullable Logger logger)
            throws IllegalConfigurationException, DynamicCodeLoadingException, IOException {

        StateBackend rootBackend =
                loadFromApplicationOrConfigOrDefaultInternal(
                        fromApplication, config, classLoader, logger);

        // Inline the variable enableChangeLog in the if condition
        if (TernaryBoolean.TRUE.equals(isChangelogStateBackendEnableFromApplication)
                || (TernaryBoolean.UNDEFINED.equals(isChangelogStateBackendEnableFromApplication)
                    && config.get(StateChangelogOptions.ENABLE_STATE_CHANGE_LOG))) {
            // ... [Rest of the if block remains unchanged] ...
        } else {
            // ... [Rest of the else block remains unchanged] ...
        }

        // ... [Rest of the method remains unchanged] ...
    }

    public static boolean stateBackendFromApplicationOrConfigOrDefaultUseManagedMemory(
            Configuration config,
            Optional<Boolean> stateBackendFromApplicationUsesManagedMemory,
            ClassLoader classLoader) {

        checkNotNull(config, "config");

        // ... [Rest of the method remains unchanged] ...

        // Inline the variable fromConfig in the return statement
        try {
            return loadStateBackendFromConfig(config, classLoader, LOG).useManagedMemory();
        } catch (IllegalConfigurationException | DynamicCodeLoadingException | IOException e) {
            // ... [Rest of the catch block remains unchanged] ...
        }
    }

    // ... [Rest of the class remains unchanged] ...
}
```

This refactoring aims to simplify the code by removing intermediate variables that are not significantly contributing to the readability or understanding of the code. It's always good to review such changes with the team or incorporate them into coding standards for consistency.
