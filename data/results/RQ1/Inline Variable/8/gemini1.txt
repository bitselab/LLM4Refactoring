 **Here's a review of the code, highlighting potential refactoring opportunities:**

**Overall Structure:**

- **Encapsulation:** Consider encapsulating configuration details for each database into separate classes to improve cohesion and reduce the size of the `SupportedDatabase` enum.
- **Database Interactions:** Introduce a common interface for database interactions to manage differences between database types more elegantly.

**Specific Points:**

- **Static Initialization:** Refactor the static initialization block into a separate method for better readability and testability.
- **Duplicate Code:** Find ways to consolidate the duplicated code within the `SupportedDatabase` enum's methods.
- **Configuration Objects:** Explore using builder patterns for flexible configuration object creation.
- **Container Management:** Separate configuration concerns from container management using dependency injection or service-based approaches.
- **Conditional Logic:** Refactor the conditional logic in the `configuration()` method to use polymorphism or a strategy pattern for cleaner code.
- **Error Handling:** Consider enhancing error handling with more meaningful messages and logging.

**Additional Considerations:**

- **Testing:** Write comprehensive unit tests to ensure code quality and support future refactoring.
- **Design Patterns:** Explore opportunities to apply design patterns (e.g., factory, strategy, or builder patterns) for a more flexible and maintainable codebase.
- **Performance Optimization:** If performance is a concern, profile the code to identify potential bottlenecks and consider optimization techniques.
- **Documentation:** Add clear comments and documentation to enhance code readability and maintainability.
- **Modularity:** Break down the class into smaller, more focused classes if it becomes too large or complex.

**Remember:** The specific refactoring actions will depend on the project's overall context, goals, and constraints. Discuss these suggestions with your team leader for a shared understanding of the best approach.
