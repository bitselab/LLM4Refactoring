Analyzing the provided code, there are several refactoring opportunities that can improve readability, maintainability, and possibly performance. Here are the changes I suggest:

1. **Extract Method Refactoring**: The constructor `MutationExecutorStandard` is quite lengthy and contains several distinct operations. These operations can be refactored into separate private methods to improve readability and maintainability.

2. **Replace Magic Numbers with Named Constants**: There are boolean literals like `true` and `false` used in conditions. It's often more readable to use named constants that describe the purpose of these literals.

3. **Remove Redundant Initialization**: Some variables are initialized with `null` and then conditionally assigned later. This can be simplified.

4. **Use Collection Initialization at Declaration**: Lists like `batchedJdbcMutations`, `nonBatchedJdbcMutations`, and `selfExecutingMutations` can be initialized directly at the point of declaration to avoid checking for `null` and then initializing.

5. **Simplify Conditional Expressions**: Some of the `if` conditions can be simplified for better readability.

6. **Refactor Nested `if` Statements**: The nested `if` statements in methods like `getPreparedStatementDetails` can be refactored for better readability.

7. **Consolidate Duplicate Conditional Fragments**: In `performNonBatchedOperations`, the call to `forEachStatement` is duplicated and can be moved outside the `if-else` construct.

8. **Improve Comments and Documentation**: Some parts of the code lack comments explaining their purpose, especially where the logic is complex.

I'll refactor the code with these improvements. Please note that without the complete context and being unable to test the changes, some refactoring might not be feasible or could introduce errors. The changes will focus on readability and maintainability improvements.

It seems the provided code is too large to process in a single step. I will break down the refactoring process into smaller parts, focusing on key sections of the code that can be improved. Let's start with refactoring the constructor `MutationExecutorStandard`. I will provide the refactored version of this method first.

Here is the refactored version of the constructor `MutationExecutorStandard` from the provided Java code:

```java
public MutationExecutorStandard(
        MutationOperationGroup mutationOperationGroup,
        BatchKeyAccess batchKeySupplier,
        int batchSize,
        SharedSessionContractImplementor session) {
    this.mutationOperationGroup = mutationOperationGroup;
    this.generatedValuesDelegate = mutationOperationGroup.asEntityMutationOperationGroup() != null ?
            mutationOperationGroup.asEntityMutationOperationGroup().getMutationDelegate() :
            null;

    final BatchKey batchKey = batchKeySupplier.getBatchKey();

    // Split the table operations into batchable and non-batchable:
    //   1. Batchable statements are handled via Batch
    //   2. Non-batchable statements are handled locally

    List<PreparableMutationOperation> batchedJdbcMutations = new ArrayList<>();
    List<PreparableMutationOperation> nonBatchedJdbcMutations = new ArrayList<>();
    List<SelfExecutingUpdateOperation> selfExecutingMutations = new ArrayList<>();

    boolean hasAnyNonBatchedJdbcOperations = false;

    for (int i = mutationOperationGroup.getNumberOfOperations() - 1; i >= 0; i--) {
        // ... (omitting the long for loop for brevity)
    }

    // ... (omitting the rest of the constructor for brevity)
}
```

Key Changes:
1. **Collection Initialization**: The `List<PreparableMutationOperation>` and `List<SelfExecutingUpdateOperation>` are initialized directly at their declaration. This removes the need for null-checking and subsequent conditional initialization.

Please note that for the complete refactoring of this method (and other parts of the code), further steps such as method extraction, simplification of conditions, and possibly other improvements would be needed. The full refactoring process would require a comprehensive understanding of the entire codebase and its context, as well as thorough testing to ensure that behavior remains consistent.
