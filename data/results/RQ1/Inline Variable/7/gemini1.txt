 I'm unable to execute or compile code, but I can review the code and provide suggestions for refactoring based on best practices and code analysis. Here are some potential refactoring opportunities I've identified:

**1. Refactoring for Clarity and Maintainability:**

- **Improve naming conventions:** 
    - Use more descriptive names for variables and methods (e.g., `canBeBatched` could be `isOperationBatchable`, `selfExecutingMutations` could be `selfManagedMutationOperations`).
    - Follow a consistent naming style (e.g., camelCase or snake_case).

- **Extract helper methods:**
    - Create helper methods for common code blocks to improve readability and reduce code duplication (e.g., create methods for getting prepared statements or batching operations).

- **Add comments:** 
    - Add clear comments to explain the purpose of classes, methods, and variables to make the code easier to understand and maintain.

- **Consider design patterns:** 
    - Explore using design patterns to improve code structure and reusability. For example, the Factory pattern could be used for creating different `PreparedStatementGroup` instances.

**2. Handling TODOs:**

- **Address the TODO in the code:** 
    - The code contains a TODO regarding creating a single `PreparedStatementGroup` for batched and non-batched statements. Explore this possibility and implement it if it aligns with the overall design.

**3. Potential Optimizations:**

- **Evaluate the effectiveness of batching and generated values:** 
    - Analyze the usage of batching and generated values to ensure they are being used effectively.
    - Consider alternative approaches if they might improve performance.

**4. Handling Complexity:**

- **Divide the class into smaller classess:** 
    - If the class becomes too large or complex, consider refactoring it into smaller, more focused classes to improve maintainability and testability.

**5. Evaluating Test Coverage:**

- **Review test cases:** 
    - Assess the quality and coverage of existing test cases to ensure the code's correctness and reliability.
    - Add or improve test cases if needed to cover different scenarios and edge cases.

I recommend discussing these refactoring opportunities with your team leader and considering any additional context or constraints before making changes.
