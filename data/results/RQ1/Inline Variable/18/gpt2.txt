In the provided code snippet, inline variable refactoring can be applied to simplify the code and enhance readability. This refactoring technique involves replacing temporary variables with direct calls to methods or expressions that created them, assuming these replacements do not impact readability negatively or cause expensive operations to be executed multiple times. Here are the opportunities I identified:

1. **Inline Temporary Variables**: Some temporary variables are used only once and can be inlined. This reduces the number of lines and variables, making the code more readable.

2. **Direct Method Calls**: Instead of storing the result of a method call in a variable and then using the variable, we can directly use the method call, if it does not reduce readability or cause performance issues.

Let's apply these refactorings to the code:

```java
package org.apache.solr.request.json;

// ... [imports remain the same]

public class RequestUtil {
    // ... [other methods remain the same]

    public static void processParams(
            SolrRequestHandler handler,
            SolrQueryRequest req,
            SolrParams defaults,
            SolrParams appends,
            SolrParams invariants) {

        boolean searchHandler = handler instanceof SearchHandler;

        // Handle JSON stream for search requests
        if (searchHandler && req.getContentStreams() != null) {
            Map<String, String[]> map = MultiMapSolrParams.asMultiMap(req.getParams(), false);
            // ... [rest of the code in this block remains the same]
        }

        // Inline 'jsonS' variable as it's used only once
        boolean hasAdditions =
                defaults != null || invariants != null || appends != null || req.getParams().getParams(JSON) != null;

        if (!hasAdditions && !req.getParams().getBool("expandMacros", true)) {
            return; // nothing to do...
        }

        boolean isShard = req.getParams().getBool("isShard", false);

        Map<String, String[]> newMap = MultiMapSolrParams.asMultiMap(req.getParams(), hasAdditions);

        if (req.getParams().getParams(JSON) != null && !isShard) {
            for (String json : req.getParams().getParams(JSON)) {
                getParamsFromJSON(newMap, json);
            }
        }

        // ... [rest of the method remains the same, ensuring no double calls to expensive operations]
    }

    // ... [other private methods remain the same]
}
```

In this refactoring, I inlined `params` and `jsonS` variables, as they were used immediately after their declaration and only once. This makes the code more direct and slightly reduces its length. It's essential to ensure that inlining does not introduce redundant calls to methods that are computationally expensive or have side effects. In this case, the inlined calls do not seem to have such implications.
