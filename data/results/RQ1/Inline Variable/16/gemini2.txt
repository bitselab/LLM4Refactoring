No refactoring is necessary for inline variables in this code snippet. The code appears to be well-structured and avoids unnecessary variable assignments. 

Here's why inline variables might not be a good fit here:

1. **Readability:** The current code uses descriptive variable names like `sent` and `failure` which improves readability compared to short, inline variables.
2. **Scope:** The variables seem to be used within the scope of their creation (e.g. `sent` within the `sendWithTimeout` method), so there's no need to pass them around or manage their lifecycle throughout the code.

However, as you review more code, you might encounter scenarios where inline variables can improve readability by reducing the number of intermediate steps.
