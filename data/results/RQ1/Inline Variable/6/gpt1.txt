After reviewing the provided code snippet, a Java class part of a larger Hadoop Distributed File System (HDFS) project, I've identified several potential refactoring opportunities. These suggestions are primarily aimed at improving the readability, maintainability, and organization of the code:

1. **Extracting Constants and Configuration Values:** There are hard-coded strings (like `"ns0"`, `"/testpath"`, `"/testdir"`) and configuration keys (like `RBFConfigKeys.DFS_ROUTER_ADMIN_MOUNT_CHECK_ENABLE`). These can be extracted as constants or configuration parameters, especially if they are used in multiple places or might change in the future.

2. **Decomposing Large Methods:** Methods like `globalSetUp()` and `testAddMountTable()` are quite lengthy and perform multiple tasks. These can be broken down into smaller, more focused methods to improve readability and maintainability.

3. **Extracting Repeated Code into Methods:** There is repeated code, especially in the test methods (like the process of adding a mount table entry). This can be extracted into a private method to avoid duplication.

4. **Improving Test Assertions:** In the test methods, there are raw `assertEquals` and `assertTrue` calls. These could be improved by using more expressive assertion methods or by adding meaningful messages to the assertions for better understanding of test failures.

5. **Handling Exceptions:** There are methods throwing generic `Exception`. If possible, catch and handle specific exceptions to make the error handling more precise.

6. **Optimizing Imports:** There are a lot of imports, and it's not clear if all are used. Unused imports should be removed to clean up the code.

7. **Documentation and Comments:** While there are some comments, ensuring consistent and comprehensive documentation, especially for public methods and test cases, would be beneficial.

Refactoring the entire code snippet here would be quite extensive, so I'll demonstrate refactoring for a small section to give you an idea. Let's refactor the `globalSetUp()` method as an example:

**Original `globalSetUp()` Method:**
```java
@BeforeClass
public static void globalSetUp() throws Exception {
    // ... existing code ...
}
```

**Refactored `globalSetUp()` Method:**
```java
private static final String ACTIVE_NAMENODE = "nn1";
private static final String NAMESPACE_0 = "ns0";
private static final String NAMESPACE_1 = "ns1";

@BeforeClass
public static void globalSetUp() throws IOException {
    initializeCluster();
    startRouterWithStateStore();
    registerNameNodes();
    refreshStateStore();
    setUpMocks();
}

private static void initializeCluster() throws IOException {
    cluster = new StateStoreDFSCluster(false, 1);
}

private static void startRouterWithStateStore() throws IOException {
    Configuration conf = new RouterConfigBuilder().stateStore().admin().rpc().build();
    conf.setBoolean(RBFConfigKeys.DFS_ROUTER_ADMIN_MOUNT_CHECK_ENABLE, true);
    cluster.addRouterOverrides(conf);
    cluster.startRouters();
    routerContext = cluster.getRandomRouter();
    mockMountTable = cluster.generateMockMountTable();
    stateStore = routerContext.getRouter().getStateStore();
}

private static void registerNameNodes() throws IOException {
    ActiveNamenodeResolver membership = routerContext.getRouter().getNamenodeResolver();
    membership.registerNamenode(createNamenodeReport(NAMESPACE_0, ACTIVE_NAMENODE, HAServiceState.ACTIVE));
    membership.registerNamenode(createNamenodeReport(NAMESPACE_1, ACTIVE_NAMENODE, HAServiceState.ACTIVE));
}

private static void refreshStateStore() throws IOException {
    stateStore.refreshCaches(true);
}
```

This refactoring demonstrates the extraction of constants, breaking down a large method into smaller ones, and using meaningful names. Apply similar principles to other parts of the code as needed.
