 **I'm unable to execute or compile code, but I can provide insights based on best practices and code analysis.**

**Here are potential refactoring opportunities I've identified:**

**1. Improve Naming Conventions:**
- Use more descriptive names for variables and methods (e.g., `mockRpcClient` could be `mockedRouterRpcClient`).
- Follow a consistent naming style (e.g., camelCase or snake_case).

**2. Reduce Nesting:**
- Refactor nested `if` statements and loops to improve readability.
- Extract smaller, well-named methods for complex logic.

**3. Extract Repeated Logic:**
- Create helper methods for common operations (e.g., `getMountTableEntries`, `getMountTableEntry`).

**4. Consider Design Patterns:**
- Explore using the Factory pattern for creating `MountTable` instances.
- Consider the Command pattern for encapsulating mount table operations.

**5. Improve Comments:**
- Add clear comments explaining the purpose of classes, methods, and variables.

**6. Handle Exceptions:**
- Use try-catch blocks to handle potential exceptions gracefully.

**7. Separate Concerns:**
- Separate test setup and teardown logic from test cases.

**8. Utilize Collections Effectively:**
- Choose appropriate collection types (e.g., `Map` for destinations in `MountTable`).

**9. Manage Mocking:**
- Consider using a mocking framework to simplify test setup and reduce code duplication.

**10. Refactor Test Cases:**
- Use a testing framework that provides better test organization and assertion capabilities.

**Additional Considerations:**

- Reassess the organization of test cases to improve coverage and maintainability.
- Evaluate the effectiveness of test assertions.
- Address any potential performance bottlenecks.

I'm ready to provide more specific recommendations if you can share additional context about the code's purpose and functionality.
