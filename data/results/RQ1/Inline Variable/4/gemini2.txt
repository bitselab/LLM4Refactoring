Yes, there is an opportunity for inline variable refactoring in the provided code snippet.

**Original Code:**

```java
final var resultsBuilder = new ResultsBuilder();
try (var refs = new RefCountingRunnable(() -> listener.onResponse(resultsBuilder.getResponse()))) {
  for (final var repositoryName : request.repositories()) {
    // ...
  }
}
```

**Refactored Code:**

```java
final RefCountingRunnable refs = new RefCountingRunnable(() -> listener.onResponse(new ResultsBuilder().getResponse()));
try (refs) {
  for (final var repositoryName : request.repositories()) {
    // ...
  }
}
```

**Explanation:**

The variable `resultsBuilder` is assigned an instance of `ResultsBuilder` and then used within the `try` block. Since it's only used once and its purpose is clear, it can be inlined by calling `new ResultsBuilder().getResponse()` directly within the `RefCountingRunnable` constructor. This reduces the number of lines and improves readability.
