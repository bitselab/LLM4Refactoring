After reviewing the code for potential inline variable refactoring opportunities, I've identified a few areas where this technique can be applied to improve readability and compactness:

1. **Inline Temporary Variables:** There are several instances where temporary variables are used only once and could be inlined for clarity. This is especially true in cases where a method returns a value that is immediately used in an assert statement or a simple operation.

2. **Consolidate Variable Declarations and Initializations:** In some cases, variables are declared first and then initialized in a separate statement. These can be consolidated into a single statement.

Let's refactor the code with these suggestions:
```java
package org.apache.lucene.index;

// ... [imports remain the same]

public class TestFieldInfos extends LuceneTestCase {

    public void testFieldInfos() throws Exception {
        Directory dir = newDirectory();
        IndexWriter writer = new IndexWriter(
                dir,
                newIndexWriterConfig(new MockAnalyzer(random()))
                        .setMergePolicy(NoMergePolicy.INSTANCE));

        // ... [rest of the setup code remains the same]

        SegmentInfos sis = SegmentInfos.readLatestCommit(dir);
        assertEquals(3, sis.size());

        // Inline fis1, fis2, and fis3
        Iterator<FieldInfo> it = IndexWriter.readFieldInfos(sis.info(0)).iterator();
        for (int i = 0; it.hasNext(); i++) {
            FieldInfo fi = it.next();
            assertEquals(i, fi.number);
            assertEquals("f" + i, fi.name);
            assertEquals("f" + i, IndexWriter.readFieldInfos(sis.info(0)).fieldInfo(i).name); // lookup by number
            assertEquals("f" + i, IndexWriter.readFieldInfos(sis.info(0)).fieldInfo("f" + i).name); // lookup by name
        }

        // ... [continue with the inlining for fis2 and fis3 as well]

        // Other test methods...
        // Inline variables as needed in testFieldAttributes, testFieldAttributesSingleSegment, etc.

        dir.close();
    }

    // ... [rest of the methods remain the same]

    public void testMergedFieldInfos_empty() throws IOException {
        Directory dir = newDirectory();
        IndexWriter writer = new IndexWriter(dir, newIndexWriterConfig(new MockAnalyzer(random())));

        // Inline actual and expected
        assertSame(FieldInfos.EMPTY, FieldInfos.getMergedFieldInfos(DirectoryReader.open(writer)));

        dir.close();
    }

    // ... [rest of the methods remain the same]
}
```

This refactoring inlines the variables `fis1`, `fis2`, `fis3`, `actual`, and `expected` to make the code more concise. Note that inlining can sometimes make the code harder to debug, so use this technique judiciously. The inlining in `testMergedFieldInfos_empty` might be controversial depending on coding style preferences, as it reduces the clarity of what's being compared. Always consider readability and maintainability alongside conciseness.
