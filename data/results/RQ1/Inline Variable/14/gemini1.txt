No major refactoring is necessary for this code. The code is well-structured with clear variable names and comments explaining the purpose of each code block. It effectively tests various functionalities of the FieldInfos class.

Here are some minor improvements that could potentially be made:

* **Use descriptive variable names:** While most variable names are clear, a couple could be improved. For instance, in `testFieldAttributes`, `type1` and `type2` could be renamed to `fieldTypeWithSingleAttribute` and `fieldTypeWithTwoAttributes` to better reflect their usage.
* **Extract common test logic:** There's some repeated logic for closing resources (e.g., `writer.close()`, `dir.close()`) at the end of each test method. This could be extracted into a separate helper method to reduce redundancy.

Overall, the code is well-written and easy to understand.
