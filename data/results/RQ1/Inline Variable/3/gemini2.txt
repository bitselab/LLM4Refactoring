The provided code snippet does contain an opportunity for inline variable refactoring.

**Original Code:**

```java
final DiffResult<SimpleClass> diffResult = new DiffResult<>(SIMPLE_TRUE, SIMPLE_FALSE, SIMPLE_TRUE.diff(SIMPLE_FALSE).getDiffs(),
        ToStringStyle.DEFAULT_STYLE, DiffBuilder.TO_STRING_FORMAT);
```

**Refactored Code:**

```java
final List<Diff<?>> diffs = SIMPLE_TRUE.diff(SIMPLE_FALSE).getDiffs();
final DiffResult<SimpleClass> diffResult = new DiffResult<>(SIMPLE_TRUE, SIMPLE_FALSE, diffs, ToStringStyle.DEFAULT_STYLE, DiffBuilder.TO_STRING_FORMAT);
```

**Explanation:**

The variable `diffs` is assigned the result of `SIMPLE_TRUE.diff(SIMPLE_FALSE).getDiffs()` before being used to create the `DiffResult` object. Since this variable is only used once and its purpose is clear, it can be eliminated by inlining the expression directly into the constructor call. This improves code readability by reducing unnecessary lines and makes the code more concise.
