The provided code is well-structured and follows good object-oriented practices, but there are still a few opportunities for refactoring to improve readability, maintainability, and efficiency. Here's a refactored version of the code:

1. **Reduce Code Duplication**: The creation of `SimpleClass` instances and the calling of `diff` method are repeated in multiple test methods. We can refactor this into a reusable method.

2. **Centralize Common Test Data**: The `SimpleClass` instances `SIMPLE_TRUE` and `SIMPLE_FALSE` are already defined as constants. We can leverage these more effectively in the tests to avoid creating new instances.

3. **Improve Test Method Names**: Test method names should clearly state what they are testing. Some of the method names can be more descriptive.

4. **Use AssertJ or Hamcrest for Better Assertions**: These libraries provide more expressive and readable assertions compared to JUnit's basic `assertEquals` and `assertTrue`.

5. **Remove Unnecessary Comments**: Comments like `// @formatter:off/on` and `// empty` are not adding value and can be removed.

Here's the refactored code:

```java
package org.apache.commons.lang3.builder;

// import statements

public class DiffResultTest extends AbstractLangTest {

    // Existing class constants

    private DiffResult<SimpleClass> createDiffResult(SimpleClass left, SimpleClass right, ToStringStyle style) {
        List<Diff<?>> diffs = left.diff(right).getDiffs();
        return new DiffResult<>(left, right, diffs, style, DiffBuilder.TO_STRING_FORMAT);
    }

    @Test
    public void testDefaultStyleIsApplied() {
        DiffResult<SimpleClass> diffResult = createDiffResult(SIMPLE_TRUE, SIMPLE_FALSE, ToStringStyle.DEFAULT_STYLE);
        assertEquals(ToStringStyle.DEFAULT_STYLE, diffResult.getToStringStyle());
    }

    @Test
    public void iteratorMatchesExpectedDiffs() {
        DiffResult<SimpleClass> list = createDiffResult(SIMPLE_TRUE, SIMPLE_FALSE, SHORT_STYLE);
        assertThat(list.iterator()).hasSameElementsAs(SIMPLE_TRUE.diff(SIMPLE_FALSE).getDiffs().iterator());
    }

    // Other test methods with similar refactoring

}
```

These changes make the code more concise, readable, and maintainable. The use of assert libraries like AssertJ is optional but recommended for more expressive tests.
