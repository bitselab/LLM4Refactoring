Reviewing the provided code snippet, several opportunities for inline variable refactoring are apparent. Inline variable refactoring is typically used to eliminate temporary variables that are only assigned once and are immediately returned or passed to another function. This can improve code readability and conciseness. Here are some suggested refactorings:

1. **Refactoring `solve` methods**: 
   - In methods such as `solve(NameExpr nameExpr)`, `solve(SimpleName nameExpr)`, etc., the variable assigned from `symbolSolver.solveSymbol` is immediately returned. This can be inlined.
   
2. **Refactoring `getType` methods**:
   - In `getType(Node node)` and `getType(Node node, boolean solveLambdas)`, the variable `res` is assigned and then returned. This variable can be inlined.

3. **Refactoring `toMethodUsage` method**:
   - In `toMethodUsage(MethodReferenceExpr methodReferenceExpr, List<ResolvedType> paramTypes)`, the variable `result` is used only for returning. This can be inlined.

4. **Refactoring `getBinaryTypeConcrete` method**:
   - In the `getBinaryTypeConcrete(Node left, Node right, boolean solveLambdas, BinaryExpr.Operator operator)` method, the variables `leftType` and `rightType` can be inlined as they are immediately used in conditional logic and not reused.

Here's the refactored code for some of these methods:

```java
// Example of refactored solve method
public SymbolReference<? extends ResolvedValueDeclaration> solve(NameExpr nameExpr) {
    return symbolSolver.solveSymbol(nameExpr.getName().getId(), nameExpr);
}

// Example of refactored getType method
public ResolvedType getType(Node node) {
    try {
        return getType(node, true);
    } catch (UnsolvedSymbolException e) {
        // ... existing logic ...
    }
}

// Example of refactored toMethodUsage method
protected MethodUsage toMethodUsage(MethodReferenceExpr methodReferenceExpr, List<ResolvedType> paramTypes) {
    // ... existing logic ...
    return MethodResolutionLogic.findMostApplicableUsage(allMethods, methodReferenceExpr.getIdentifier(), paramTypes, typeSolver)
        .orElseThrow(() -> new UnsupportedOperationException());
}

// Example of refactored getBinaryTypeConcrete method
protected ResolvedType getBinaryTypeConcrete(Node left, Node right, boolean solveLambdas, BinaryExpr.Operator operator) {
    // ... existing logic using inlined leftType and rightType ...
}
```

Note that the above examples illustrate the approach for inline variable refactoring and do not cover the entire codebase. It's advisable to review the entire codebase for similar opportunities. This refactoring should be done with understanding the context and ensuring that the readability and maintainability of the code are not compromised.
