There is an inline variable refactoring opportunity in the following code snippet:

```java
        if (positions.length > 0) {
            int maxPosition = positions[positions.length - 1];
            for (int i = 0; i < positions.length - 1; ++i) {
                if (positions[i] > maxPosition) {
                    maxPosition = positions[i];
                }
            }
        }
```

The variable `maxPosition` is initialized with the value of `positions[positions.length - 1]` and then subsequently updated within the loop if a larger value is found. This logic can be refactored to directly iterate through the positions array and find the maximum value, eliminating the need for the `maxPosition` variable.

Here's the refactored code:

```java
        if (positions.length > 0) {
            int maxPosition = Integer.MIN_VALUE;
            for (int i = 0; i < positions.length; ++i) {
                maxPosition = Math.max(maxPosition, positions[i]);
            }
        }
```

In this refactored version, we initialize `maxPosition` with the minimum possible integer value (`Integer.MIN_VALUE`) and then use the `Math.max` function to update it with the larger value between the current `maxPosition` and the current element in the `positions` array during each iteration. This approach avoids the need for an extra variable and achieves the same functionality.
