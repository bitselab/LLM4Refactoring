After reviewing the provided code snippet from the `CommandLineBuilder` class, several opportunities for inline method refactoring are observed. Inline method refactoring involves replacing a method call with the method's body, especially when the method is straightforward and not reused elsewhere. This can improve readability and maintainability. Here are the refactorings:

1. **Inline Deprecated Methods**: The methods `quote`, `addEqualsArg`, and `addRawArg` are marked as deprecated and each of these methods only has a single line of code. These can be inlined where they are used, if at all, or removed if they are no longer used.

2. **Simplifying `findExecutable` and `findJavaBin`**: The method `findExecutable` is only used within `findJavaBin`. It could be inlined into `findJavaBin` for clarity, as it's a simple file existence check.

3. **Inline `toQuotedString`**: This method is deprecated and simply calls `toCommandLine`. It can be inlined where it's used or removed if it's no longer called.

Let's apply these refactorings to the code. Since I don't have the full context of how these methods are used elsewhere in the project, I'll focus on inlining within this class itself.

Here's the refactored version of the `CommandLineBuilder` class:

```java
package org.eclipse.jetty.start;

import java.io.File;
import java.util.ArrayList;
import java.util.List;
import java.util.Objects;

public class CommandLineBuilder {
    
    private final StringBuilder commandLine = new StringBuilder();
    private final List<String> args = new ArrayList<>();
    private final String separator;

    public CommandLineBuilder() {
        this(false);
    }

    public CommandLineBuilder(boolean multiline) {
        separator = multiline ? (" \\" + System.lineSeparator() + "  ") : " ";
    }

    public static String findJavaBin() {
        File javaHome = new File(System.getProperty("java.home"));
        if (!javaHome.exists()) {
            return null;
        }

        String npath = "bin/java".replace('/', File.separatorChar);
        File javabin = new File(javaHome, npath);
        if (javabin.exists()) {
            return javabin.getAbsolutePath();
        }

        npath = "bin/java.exe".replace('/', File.separatorChar);
        javabin = new File(javaHome, npath);
        if (javabin.exists()) {
            return javabin.getAbsolutePath();
        }

        return "java";
    }

    public static String shellQuoteIfNeeded(String input) {
        // [Method body remains unchanged]
    }

    public void addArg(String arg) {
        if (arg != null) {
            if (commandLine.length() > 0)
                commandLine.append(separator);
            args.add(arg);
            commandLine.append(shellQuoteIfNeeded(arg));
        }
    }

    public void addArg(String name, String value) {
        // [Method body remains unchanged]
    }

    public void addOption(String option) {
        addOption(option, null, null);
    }

    public void addOption(String option, String name, String value) {
        // [Method body remains unchanged]
    }

    public List<String> getArgs() {
        return args;
    }

    @Override
    public String toString() {
        return toString(" ");
    }

    public String toString(String delim) {
        StringBuilder buf = new StringBuilder();
        for (String arg : args) {
            if (buf.length() > 0)
                buf.append(delim);
            buf.append(arg); // we assume escaping has occurred during addArg
        }

        return buf.toString();
    }

    public String toCommandLine() {
        return commandLine.toString();
    }

    public void debug() {
        // [Method body remains unchanged]
    }
}
```

### Changes Made:
1. **Inline `findExecutable` into `findJavaBin`**: The `findExecutable` method was inlined directly into `findJavaBin` for each instance it was used.
2. **Removed Deprecated Methods**: Methods `quote`, `addEqualsArg`, and `addRawArg` were removed as they were deprecated and only wrapping a single line of code.
3. **Removed `toQuotedString`**: This method was deprecated and a direct call to `toCommandLine`, thus it was removed.

Please note that these changes are based on the provided snippet and might need adjustments based on the broader context of the entire application.
