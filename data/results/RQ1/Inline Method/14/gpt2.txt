In the provided `MSBRadixSorter` class, one potential inline method refactoring opportunity is the `introSort` method. This method is quite short and is only called once within the `sort` method. By inlining `introSort`, we can reduce the method count without significantly impacting the readability of the code. 

Inline refactoring of `introSort` would replace its call in the `sort` method with the body of `introSort`. This change is minor but can make the flow of the `sort` method slightly more direct, as it eliminates an unnecessary method call.

Here's the refactored version of the code with `introSort` inlined:

```java
package org.apache.lucene.util;

import java.util.Arrays;

// ... [omitting unchanged parts for brevity]

public abstract class MSBRadixSorter extends Sorter {

    // ... [omitting unchanged fields and constructor for brevity]

    @Override
    public void sort(int from, int to) {
        checkRange(from, to);
        sort(from, to, 0, 0);
    }

    protected void sort(int from, int to, int k, int l) {
        if (shouldFallback(from, to, l)) {
            // Inline method refactoring of introSort
            getFallbackSorter(k).sort(from, to); // Replaces the call to introSort(from, to, k)
        } else {
            radixSort(from, to, k, l);
        }
    }

    // ... [omitting unchanged methods for brevity]

}
```

In this refactoring, I have removed the `introSort` method and directly used its content where it was called in the `sort` method. This change is relatively minor but aligns with the principle of inlining methods that are short, not reused, and do not significantly contribute to the clarity or organization of the code. 

All other methods seem to have their specific responsibilities and are well-structured, so they are retained as is.
