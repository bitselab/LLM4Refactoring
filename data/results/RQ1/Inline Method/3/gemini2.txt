The provided code snippet presents an ideal scenario for Inline Method refactoring. The `validateNullToStringStyleRegistry` method is a private method used only within the `after` method of the same class. Inlining this method would improve code readability and maintainability by eliminating unnecessary method calls.

Here's the refactored code:

```java
package org.apache.commons.lang3;

import static org.junit.jupiter.api.Assertions.assertNull;

import org.apache.commons.lang3.builder.ToStringStyle;
import org.junit.jupiter.api.AfterEach;

/**
 * All tests subclass this test.
 */
public class AbstractLangTest {

  /**
   * All tests should leave the {@link ToStringStyle} registry empty.
   */
  @AfterEach
  public void after() {
    assertNull(ToStringStyle.getRegistry(), "Expected null, actual: " + ToStringStyle.getRegistry());
  }

}
```

The `validateNullToStringStyleRegistry` method has been removed, and its logic has been directly incorporated into the `after` method using inline refactoring. This reduces code duplication and improves readability.
