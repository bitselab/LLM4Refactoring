 **Here's the refactored code:**

```java
package org.apache.commons.lang3;

import static org.junit.jupiter.api.Assertions.assertNull;

import org.apache.commons.lang3.builder.ToStringStyle;
import org.junit.jupiter.api.AfterEach;

/**
 * All tests subclass this test.
 */
public abstract class AbstractLangTest {

    @AfterEach
    public void validateNullToStringStyleRegistry() {
        assertNull(ToStringStyle.getRegistry(), "Expected null ToStringStyle registry");
    }

}
```

**Explanation of refactorings:**

1. **Method visibility:** Changed `validateNullToStringStyleRegistry()` from `package-private` to `public`. This allows for better testability and reusability of the method.
2. **Class declaration:** Declared `AbstractLangTest` as `abstract` since it's intended as a base class for other tests.
3. **Redundant method call:** Removed the redundant call to `ToStringStyle.getRegistry()` in the assertion message. The method is already called for the assertion itself, and repeating it in the message adds no value.
4. **Verbosity:** Simplified the assertion message to "Expected null ToStringStyle registry". The original message was slightly more verbose than necessary.

**Considerations:**

- **Scope of refactoring:** While these refactorings improve code clarity and maintainability, it's worth considering the broader context of the project and any potential implications of these changes.
- **Testing:** Ensure that any refactorings are accompanied by appropriate updates to unit tests to maintain test coverage.
- **Team collaboration:** Discuss refactoring suggestions with team members to ensure alignment and avoid any unintended side effects.
