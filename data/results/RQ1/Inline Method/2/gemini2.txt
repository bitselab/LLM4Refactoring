The provided code snippet does not contain a method that can be inlined using the Inline Method refactoring technique.

Inline Method refactoring is applicable when a small and well-defined method is used only in one location within the codebase. In this case, all methods within the code snippet are used throughout the class and serve specific purposes.  

For instance, the `testSingleByteRead` method is used in multiple tests to validate single-byte character reading functionality across various charsets. Inlining this method would lead to code duplication and make the tests harder to maintain.

Therefore, no refactoring using Inline Method is necessary for the provided code.
