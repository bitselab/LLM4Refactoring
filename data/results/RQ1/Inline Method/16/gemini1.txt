Absolutely, here are some refactoring opportunities for the provided code snippet:

1. **Reduce Code Duplication:** There's a code block repeated twice for checking if `zkHost` property exists and setting it based on system property (`wrapAndSetZkHostFromSysPropIfNeeded`). This can be refactored into a separate method to improve readability and maintainability.

2. **Use Optional for substituteProperties:** The `substituteProperties` parameter is a `Properties` object but it can be null in some cases. Consider using `Optional<Properties>` to handle the possibility of it being absent more explicitly.

3. **Simplify `checkForIllegalConfig`:** This method does multiple checks for specific attributes in the configuration. You can potentially leverage libraries like `Apache Commons Validator` to simplify these checks.

4. **Use Stream API for `loadProperties`:** The `loadProperties` method iterates over child nodes and builds a `Properties` object. This can be refactored using streams for a more concise and functional approach.

5. **Consider Builder Pattern for `NodeConfig`:** The `fillSolrSection` method constructs a `NodeConfig` object by setting various properties. This can be improved by using the Builder pattern to create a more readable and chained approach for setting configurations.

6. **Extract Helper Methods:** Some logic within `fillSolrSection` for handling specific properties might benefit from being extracted into separate helper methods for better organization and reusability.

Remember, these are just suggestions, and the specific refactoring approach might depend on your coding style and project requirements.
