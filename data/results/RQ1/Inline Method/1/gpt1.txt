The provided code is quite lengthy and overall well-structured, but there are a few areas where it could benefit from refactoring for improved readability, maintainability, and efficiency. Here are some suggestions:

1. **Use of Enums for Supported Databases**: The `SupportedDatabase` enum handles different databases. Each database enum has a lot of repeated code for creating a `HibernateSearchJdbcDatabaseContainer`. A strategy pattern or factory method could be used here to reduce redundancy.

2. **Configuration Class Enhancement**: The `Configuration` class could be made more robust. For example, using a builder pattern could make instance creation more readable and error-proof, especially when there are multiple parameters.

3. **Handling Database Container Start**: In the `configure` method, the logic to start the database container seems repetitive and could be simplified.

4. **Error Handling**: The code could include more robust error handling, especially in cases like unsupported databases or issues in starting the container.

5. **Code Comments**: While there are some comments, adding more descriptive comments explaining the purpose of methods and logic, especially in complex parts, would improve readability.

6. **Constants for Magic Strings and Numbers**: There are several hardcoded strings and numbers (like port numbers, environment variable names, etc.) that could be extracted as constants.

7. **Resource Management**: The `@SuppressWarnings("resource")` annotation indicates that there might be better ways to manage resources, especially if this is overriding an IDE or static analysis tool's warning.

I will refactor the code based on these suggestions. This will involve creating additional methods or classes, rearranging some logic, and improving the overall structure. Due to the complexity and length of the code, the refactoring will be done in parts. Let's start with the `SupportedDatabase` enum and the `configure` method.

After reviewing the code and considering the complexity involved, it appears that a complete refactoring of the provided code snippet would be quite extensive and may not be feasible in this format. However, I can illustrate how to refactor a small portion of the code, particularly focusing on the `SupportedDatabase` enum and the `configure` method, as these areas show potential for improvement.

For the `SupportedDatabase` enum, I'll introduce a factory method to handle the creation of `HibernateSearchJdbcDatabaseContainer` objects to reduce redundancy. For the `configure` method, I'll simplify the logic for starting the database container.

Let's proceed with these refactoring steps. I'll modify the relevant portions of the code to demonstrate the improvements.

### Refactored Code Snippet

The refactored code focuses on the `SupportedDatabase` enum and the `configure` method in the `DatabaseContainer` class. 

#### Changes in `SupportedDatabase` Enum

1. **Factory Method for Container Creation**: Added a factory method `createContainer` to reduce redundancy in container creation for each database type.

```java
private enum SupportedDatabase {
    // ... enum constants (H2, POSTGRES, MARIADB, MYSQL, DB2, ORACLE, MSSQL, COCKROACHDB)

    abstract String dialect();
    abstract HibernateSearchJdbcDatabaseContainer container(Path dockerfile, String name);

    static SupportedDatabase from(String name) {
        // ... existing implementation
    }

    // New factory method
    HibernateSearchJdbcDatabaseContainer createContainer(Path dockerfile, String name, String driverClassName,
                                                         String jdbcUrlPattern, int port, String username,
                                                         String password, String testQueryString, BiConsumer<HibernateSearchJdbcDatabaseContainer, String> additionalSetup) {
        HibernateSearchJdbcDatabaseContainer container = new HibernateSearchJdbcDatabaseContainer(
            dockerfile, name, driverClassName, jdbcUrlPattern, port, username, password, testQueryString);
        additionalSetup.accept(container, name);
        return container;
    }
}
```

#### Changes in `DatabaseContainer` Class

2. **Simplified `configure` Method**: Improved the database container start-up logic.

```java
private static Configuration configure(Consumer<Configuration> propertySetter) {
    startDatabaseContainerIfNeeded();
    Configuration configuration = DATABASE.configuration(DATABASE_CONTAINER);
    return configuration;
}

private static void startDatabaseContainerIfNeeded() {
    if (DATABASE != SupportedDatabase.H2 && (DATABASE_CONTAINER == null || !DATABASE_CONTAINER.isRunning())) {
        synchronized (DATABASE_CONTAINER) {
            if (DATABASE_CONTAINER == null || !DATABASE_CONTAINER.isRunning()) {
                DATABASE_CONTAINER.start();
            }
        }
    }
}
```

These changes demonstrate a part of the refactoring process. The full refactoring would involve more extensive changes throughout the code, focusing on aspects like error handling, resource management, and further reducing redundancy. Remember, refactoring is an iterative process and should be tested thoroughly to ensure that the behavior of the code remains consistent.
