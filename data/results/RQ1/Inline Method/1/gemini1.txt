No refactoring is strictly necessary for this code. It follows a well-structured format, uses descriptive variable names, and separates concerns well between classes. 

However, there are a few minor improvements that could be considered:

1. **Database Configuration Consolidation:** The `HibernateSearchJdbcDatabaseContainer` class has some repeated logic for setting up common properties like exposed ports, reuse, and startup timeout. This could be consolidated into a protected method or separate base class for all the database containers.

2. **Consider Enums over Strings for `SupportedDatabase`:** While the current approach with `SupportedDatabase` functions well, using an Enum could provide better type safety and code completion.

These are minor improvements and the current code is well-written.
