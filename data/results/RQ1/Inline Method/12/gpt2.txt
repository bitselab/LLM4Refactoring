Examining the provided code, one area where inline method refactoring might be applicable is the `toWrapperType` method in the `DefaultArgumentConverter` class. This method is a straightforward utility that could be inlined for clarity and to reduce the overall method count, especially if it's only used in one place.

Let's refactor the `convertToTargetType` method by inlining the `toWrapperType` call:

Original method:
```java
private Object convertToTargetType(Object source, Class<?> targetType, ParameterContext context) {
    if (source instanceof String) {
        Class<?> targetTypeToUse = toWrapperType(targetType);
        // ... rest of the method ...
    }
    // ... rest of the method ...
}
```

Refactored method:
```java
private Object convertToTargetType(Object source, Class<?> targetType, ParameterContext context) {
    if (source instanceof String) {
        Class<?> targetTypeToUse = getWrapperType(targetType) != null ? getWrapperType(targetType) : targetType;
        // ... rest of the method ...
    }
    // ... rest of the method ...
}
```

After this change, the `toWrapperType` method can be removed, as its functionality is now directly included in the `convertToTargetType` method. This change makes the code slightly more direct and reduces the overhead of an additional method call, which can be beneficial especially if this method is called frequently.

It's important to note that inline refactoring should be used judiciously, especially if the method being inlined offers significant abstraction or is used in multiple places. In this case, since `toWrapperType` is a simple utility method, its inlining should not adversely affect readability or maintainability.
