No refactoring is necessary for the provided code snippet.

The code utilizes a chain of responsibility pattern with the `StringToObjectConverter` interface. This design principle promotes loose coupling and makes the code easier to understand and maintain. Additionally, the use of static final collections and helper methods improves readability.

While inline methods could be implemented for some of the converter implementations within the `StringToObjectConverter` interface, it might not be the most beneficial approach in this case. The current structure promotes code reuse and maintainability.
