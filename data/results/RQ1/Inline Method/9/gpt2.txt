Analyzing the provided code, I notice an immediate opportunity for inline method refactoring. The method `createNonCustomizedTextField()` is a candidate for this kind of refactoring. This method is simply creating a new `ExtendableTextField` without any additional logic or customization. Inlining this method would improve readability by reducing the unnecessary abstraction.

Here's how the refactored code would look:

```java
// Import statements remain the same

public class NewItemSimplePopupPanel extends JBPanel implements Disposable {
    // Class fields remain the same

    public NewItemSimplePopupPanel() {
        this(false);
    }

    public NewItemSimplePopupPanel(boolean liveValidation) {
        super(new BorderLayout());

        myTextField = createTextField(liveValidation);
        add(myTextField, BorderLayout.NORTH);

        myErrorShowPoint = new RelativePoint(myTextField, new Point(0, myTextField.getHeight()));
    }

    // Other methods remain unchanged

    protected @NotNull ExtendableTextField createTextField(boolean liveErrorValidation) {
        ExtendableTextField res = new ExtendableTextField(); // Inlined here

        // Rest of the method remains the same

        return res;
    }

    // Rest of the class remains unchanged
}
```

Refactoring Summary:
- The method `createNonCustomizedTextField` was inlined inside `createTextField`, directly replacing its call with `new ExtendableTextField()`.
- Other parts of the code were left unchanged as they seem to be well-structured and serve specific purposes.

This refactoring simplifies the code by removing an unnecessary method, thereby improving its overall readability.
