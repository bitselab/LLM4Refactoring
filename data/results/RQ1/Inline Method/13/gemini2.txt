Yes, there is a refactoring opportunity in this code snippet using the inline method technique.

The private method `valueOf` has a very simple function and directly delegates the call to the `Enum.valueOf` method. In this case, inlining the functionality of `valueOf` within the `convert` method improves readability and reduces nesting.

Here's the refactored code:

```java
package org.junit.jupiter.params.converter;

class StringToEnumConverter implements StringToObjectConverter {

  @Override
  public boolean canConvert(Class<?> targetType) {
    return targetType.isEnum();
  }

  @Override
  public Object convert(String source, Class<?> targetType) throws Exception {
    @SuppressWarnings("unchecked") // Safe cast because canConvert ensures targetType is an Enum
    return Enum.valueOf((Class<Enum>) targetType, source);
  }
}
```

In the refactored code, we removed the private method `valueOf` and directly used `Enum.valueOf` within the `convert` method. We also added a cast to `Class<Enum>` to ensure type safety, but this cast is safe because the `canConvert` method already guarantees that `targetType` is an Enum class.
