The provided Java code snippet for a `StringToEnumConverter` can benefit from an inline method refactoring. The `valueOf` method is a private static method that's only being used once in the `convert` method. Its functionality is straightforward, as it simply delegates to `Enum.valueOf`. This is a classic case where inline method refactoring can be applied to improve readability and reduce unnecessary method indirection.

Here's the refactored code:

```java
package org.junit.jupiter.params.converter;

class StringToEnumConverter implements StringToObjectConverter {

    @Override
    public boolean canConvert(Class<?> targetType) {
        return targetType.isEnum();
    }

    @Override
    public Object convert(String source, Class<?> targetType) throws Exception {
        return Enum.valueOf(targetType, source);
    }

}
```

Changes Made:

- The `valueOf` method has been removed.
- Its functionality is now directly included in the `convert` method.

This refactoring simplifies the class by removing an unnecessary level of method call, making the code more direct and easier to follow. The behavior of the `convert` method remains the same.
