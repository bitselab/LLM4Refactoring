The provided code is an example from the Apache Solr project and it's quite extensive, illustrating a common scenario in large software projects where classes grow complex over time. While the code seems to be well-structured and follows good programming practices, there are several opportunities for refactoring to improve readability, maintainability, and possibly performance. Here's a summary of potential refactoring strategies:

1. **Extract Method**: The class contains several large methods, which could benefit from being broken down into smaller methods. This improves readability and maintainability. For example, methods like `fillSolrSection` and `loadUpdateConfig` could have their inner logic extracted into smaller methods.

2. **Remove Duplication**: There are instances of code duplication, such as repeated null checks or similar logic in different methods. Extracting these into common methods can reduce redundancy.

3. **Use of Java 8 Features**: The code could leverage Java 8 features, such as Streams and Lambdas, to make the code more concise and readable, especially in operations involving collections.

4. **Consolidate Conditional Expressions**: Some methods have multiple conditional expressions that can be consolidated for clarity.

5. **Improve Error Handling**: Some methods throw generic exceptions. It might be beneficial to create more specific exception classes or handle exceptions more gracefully in certain scenarios.

6. **Optimize Imports**: There are a lot of imports, some of which might be unused. Organizing and optimizing imports can clean up the file.

7. **Documentation and Comments**: While there are comments throughout the code, ensuring that each method has clear JavaDoc comments explaining its purpose, parameters, and return values would be helpful.

8. **Variable Naming**: Ensure that all variables are meaningfully named to improve the readability of the code.

Let's refactor a small portion of the code, focusing on the `fillSolrSection` method as an example. We will extract some of the logic into smaller methods for better readability. I will refactor this method and provide the refactored code. Note that this is just an example, and a thorough review should be done for the entire class.

I've refactored the `fillSolrSection` method from the provided code. The refactoring mainly involves breaking down the method into smaller, more manageable methods. This enhances readability and maintainability. Here's the refactored code snippet:

```java
private static NodeConfig fillSolrSection(NodeConfig.NodeConfigBuilder builder, ConfigNode root) {

    forEachNamedListEntry(
            root,
            it -> {
                if (it.name().equals("null")) return;
                processConfigNode(builder, it);
            });

    return builder.build();
}

private static void processConfigNode(NodeConfig.NodeConfigBuilder builder, ConfigNode it) {
    try {
        String name = it.attr(NAME);
        switch (name) {
            case "adminHandler":
                builder.setCoreAdminHandlerClass(it.txt());
                break;
            // ... other cases ...
            case "allowUrls":
                builder.setAllowUrls(separateStrings(it.txt()));
                break;
            default:
                handleUnknownConfig(name);
        }
    } catch (NumberFormatException e) {
        throw new SolrException(
                SolrException.ErrorCode.SERVER_ERROR,
                "Error parsing '" + name + "', value '" + it.txt() + "' cannot be parsed");
    }
}

private static void handleUnknownConfig(String name) {
    throw a SolrException(
            SolrException.ErrorCode.SERVER_ERROR,
            "Unknown configuration value in solr.xml: " + name);
}
```

In this refactoring, I've done the following:
1. Extracted the logic within the lambda passed to `forEachNamedListEntry` into a new method `processConfigNode`. This method takes care of processing each `ConfigNode`.
2. Created a `handleUnknownConfig` method to handle the default case in the switch statement. This segregates the error handling for unknown configurations.

This refactoring approach makes the code more modular and easier to read. Each method now has a single responsibility, making it easier to understand and maintain. Additionally, it paves the way for further refactoring, like breaking down the `processConfigNode` method even more if needed.

Note: This is just a part of the overall refactoring process. A thorough review should be done for the entire class to identify and implement similar improvements throughout.
