Absolutely, here are some refactoring opportunities for the provided code:

1. **Reduce Code Duplication in `getState` methods:** Notice how there are two `getState` methods, one in the `State` enum and another in the `Replica` class.  These can be merged into a single method  placed in the `State` enum to improve code maintainability.

2. **Simplify `validate` method:**  The `validate` method performs a lot of null checks. While necessary, these checks can be simplified using the `Objects.requireNonNull` method from Java 11 or a custom utility method for pre-Java 11 environments.

3. **Consider using Builder Pattern:** The constructor for `Replica`  takes multiple parameters and has some logic for default values. This pattern can be improved using the Builder pattern, which would make the construction of `Replica` objects more readable.

4. **Use Optional for `perReplicaStatesRef`:** The `perReplicaStatesRef` field is an `AtomicReference` that might be null. Consider using an `Optional` instead to represent the possible absence of the reference and handle it with appropriate checks.

Here's an example of the refactored code with these improvements:

```java
public class Replica extends ZkNodeProps implements MapWriter {

  private static final Map<String, State> STATES = initStates();

  private final String name;
  private final String node;
  private final String core;
  private final Type type;
  private final String shard, collection;
  private final AtomicReference<Optional<PerReplicaStates.State>> perReplicaStatesRef;
  private State state;

  private static Map<String, State> initStates() {
    Map<String, State> states = new HashMap<>();
    for (State state : State.values()) {
      states.put(state.shortName, state);
    }
    return states;
  }

  public static State getState(String shortName) {
    return STATES.get(shortName);
  }

  // ... other fields and methods

  private Replica(Builder builder) {
    this.name = builder.name;
    this.node = builder.node;
    this.core = builder.core;
    this.type = builder.type;
    this.shard = builder.shard;
    this.collection = builder.collection;
    this.perReplicaStatesRef = builder.perReplicaStatesRef;
    this.state = builder.state != null ? builder.state : State.ACTIVE;
    validate();
  }

  public static Builder builder() {
    return new Builder();
  }

  public static class Builder {
    private String name;
    private String node;
    private String core;
    private Type type;
    private String shard;
    private String collection;
    private AtomicReference<Optional<PerReplicaStates.State>> perReplicaStatesRef;
    private State state;

    public Builder name(String name) {
      this.name = name;
      return this;
    }

    // setters for other fields

    public Replica build() {
      return new Replica(this);
    }
  }

  private void validate() {
    Objects.requireNonNull(name, "'name' must not be null");
    // ... other null checks
  }

  // ... other methods
}
```

These are just some suggestions, and the best approach might depend on your specific coding standards and preferences.
