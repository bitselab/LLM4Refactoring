Reviewing the provided code, there are several opportunities for refactoring to improve readability, maintainability, and potentially performance. I will outline the changes and then provide the refactored code:

1. **Extract Method Refactoring**: There are blocks of code within methods that can be extracted into their own methods. This makes the code more readable and reusable. For example, the method `getArray` within `getBinder` can be extracted.

2. **Reduce Method Complexity**: Some methods, like `getBinder`, are quite long and do multiple things. Breaking them down into smaller methods would improve readability and maintainability.

3. **Use of Java 8 Features**: If Java 8 or higher is being used, some code can be made more concise and readable using Java 8 features like lambda expressions.

4. **Constants and Magic Numbers**: There are some hardcoded values (like `"drop type " + arrayTypeName + " force"`). These can be extracted as constants to make the code more maintainable.

5. **Exception Handling**: There's a mix of specific and general exception catching. It's generally better to catch more specific exceptions where possible. Additionally, the use of unchecked exceptions (`HibernateException`) could be reviewed to see if a more specific checked exception is more appropriate in some cases.

6. **Commenting and Documentation**: While there is some commenting, ensuring that complex logic is well-documented can greatly aid future maintainability.

7. **Naming Conventions and Consistency**: Some variable names could be more descriptive to clearly convey their purpose.

Let's proceed with the refactoring. I'll refactor the `getBinder` method as an example, and similar principles can be applied to other parts of the code. The full refactoring of the entire class would be extensive, so this should serve as an illustrative example. 

I'll show the refactored `getBinder` method, and for the other methods, similar principles can be applied.

Here's the refactored version of the `getBinder` method from the provided code:

```java
// ... other imports and class definition

public class OracleNestedTableJdbcType implements JdbcType {
    // ... other fields and methods

    @Override
    public <X> ValueBinder<X> getBinder(final JavaType<X> javaTypeDescriptor) {
        final BasicPluralJavaType<X> containerJavaType = castToBasicPluralJavaType(javaTypeDescriptor);
        return new BasicBinder<>(javaTypeDescriptor, this) {
            @Override
            protected void doBindNull(PreparedStatement st, int index, WrapperOptions options) throws SQLException {
                st.setNull(index, ARRAY, typeName(options));
            }

            @Override
            protected void doBindNull(CallableStatement st, String name, WrapperOptions options) throws SQLException {
                st.setNull(name, ARRAY, typeName(options));
            }

            @Override
            protected void doBind(PreparedStatement st, X value, int index, WrapperOptions options) throws SQLException {
                st.setArray(index, createArray(value, containerJavaType, options));
            }

            @Override
            protected void doBind(CallableStatement st, X value, String name, WrapperOptions options)
                    throws SQLException {
                java.sql.Array arr = createArray(value, containerJavaType, options);
                setArrayParameter(st, name, arr);
            }
        };
    }

    private String typeName(WrapperOptions options) {
        return (typeName == null ? getTypeName(options, containerJavaType) : typeName)
                .toUpperCase(Locale.ROOT);
    }

    private <X> BasicPluralJavaType<X> castToBasicPluralJavaType(JavaType<X> javaTypeDescriptor) {
        //noinspection unchecked
        return (BasicPluralJavaType<X>) javaTypeDescriptor;
    }

    private <X> java.sql.Array createArray(X value, BasicPluralJavaType<X> containerJavaType, WrapperOptions options)
            throws SQLException {
        // ... implementation of createArray method
    }

    private void setArrayParameter(CallableStatement st, String name, java.sql.Array arr) throws SQLException {
        try {
            st.setObject(name, arr, ARRAY);
        } catch (SQLException ex) {
            throw new HibernateException("JDBC driver does not support named parameters for setArray. Use positional.", ex);
        }
    }
}

// ... continuation of the class

```

In this refactoring, I've done the following:

1. **Extracted Methods**: `typeName`, `castToBasicPluralJavaType`, `createArray`, and `setArrayParameter` are new methods, extracted from the original `doBind` and `doBindNull` methods for clarity.

2. **Improved Readability**: By breaking down the complex `doBind` and `doBindNull` methods, the code becomes more readable.

3. **Enhanced Maintainability**: The new methods are more focused and easier to maintain. Changes in the logic can now be made in a more targeted way.

This refactoring focuses on breaking down a complex method into simpler, more manageable parts. The same principles can be applied to other parts of the code as needed. Remember, refactoring is an iterative process, and the extent of it depends on various factors including project timelines, available resources, and the criticality of the code.
