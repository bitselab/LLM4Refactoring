After reviewing the provided code snippet, the primary refactoring opportunity lies in improving the attribute names to enhance readability and clarity. Here are the suggested changes:

1. **Rename `leftS` and `rightS` in `SDiff` Class**: 
   The names `leftS` and `rightS` in the `SDiff` class are not immediately clear. They represent suppliers for the left and right values, so a more descriptive name would be beneficial. Suggested names: `leftSupplier` and `rightSupplier`.

2. **Rename `lhs` and `rhs` Parameters**: 
   In various methods, parameters `lhs` (left-hand side) and `rhs` (right-hand side) are used. While these are somewhat standard in diff contexts, they could be more descriptive. Suggested names: `leftObject` and `rightObject`.

3. **Improve Clarity of `objectsEquals`**: 
   The variable name `objectsEquals` is slightly misleading as it stores the result of an equality test. A name like `areObjectsEqual` would be more intuitive.

4. **Clarify `diffs` List Purpose**: 
   The `diffs` list holds the differences between objects. Renaming it to `differences` or `diffList` could make its purpose clearer.

5. **Improve `add` Method's Parameter Names**: 
   The `add` method uses generic parameter names like `left` and `right`. While these are not incorrect, they could be more descriptive. Suggested names: `leftValueSupplier` and `rightValueSupplier`.

Here is the refactored code implementing the above suggestions:

```java
package org.apache.commons.lang3.builder;

// ... [imports remain unchanged]

public class DiffBuilder<T> implements Builder<DiffResult<T>> {

    private static final class SDiff<T> extends Diff<T> {

        private static final long serialVersionUID = 1L;
        private final transient Supplier<T> leftSupplier;
        private final transient Supplier<T> rightSupplier;

        private SDiff(final String fieldName, final Supplier<T> leftSupplier, final Supplier<T> rightSupplier, final Class<T> type) {
            super(fieldName, type);
            this.leftSupplier = leftSupplier;
            this.rightSupplier = rightSupplier;
        }

        @Override
        public T getLeft() {
            return leftSupplier.get();
        }

        @Override
        public T getRight() {
            return rightSupplier.get();
        }

    }
    static final String TO_STRING_FORMAT = "%s differs from %s";

    private final List<Diff<?>> diffList;
    private final boolean areObjectsEqual;
    private final T leftObject;
    private final T rightObject;
    private final ToStringStyle style;
    private final String toStringFormat;

    public DiffBuilder(final T leftObject, final T rightObject, final ToStringStyle style) {
        this(leftObject, rightObject, style, true);
    }

    public DiffBuilder(final T leftObject, final T rightObject, final ToStringStyle style, final boolean testObjectsEquals) {
        this.leftObject = Objects.requireNonNull(leftObject, "Left object cannot be null");
        this.rightObject = Objects.requireNonNull(rightObject, "Right object cannot be null");
        this.diffList = new ArrayList<>();
        this.toStringFormat = DiffBuilder.TO_STRING_FORMAT;
        this.style = style != null ? style : ToStringStyle.DEFAULT_STYLE;
        this.areObjectsEqual = testObjectsEquals && Objects.equals(leftObject, rightObject);
    }

    private <F> DiffBuilder<T> add(final String fieldName, final Supplier<F> leftValueSupplier, final Supplier<F> rightValueSupplier, final Class<F> type) {
        diffList.add(new SDiff<>(Objects.requireNonNull(fieldName, "Field name cannot be null"), leftValueSupplier, rightValueSupplier, type));
        return this;
    }

    // ... [other methods remain unchanged, applying the renamed variables where necessary]

    @Override
    public DiffResult<T> build() {
        return new DiffResult<>(leftObject, rightObject, diffList, style, toStringFormat);
    }

    // ... [rest of the class remains unchanged]
}
```

These renaming refactorings aim to make the code more readable and understandable, especially for developers who might be new to the codebase. It's crucial to ensure that these changes do not conflict with any existing naming conventions in the broader project or library. Additionally, extensive testing should be done to ensure that the refactoring does not introduce any bugs.
