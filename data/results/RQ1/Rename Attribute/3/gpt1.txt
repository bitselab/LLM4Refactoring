After reviewing the provided code snippet, which is a part of the Apache Commons Lang library, specifically the `DiffBuilder` class, there are a few refactoring opportunities that could improve the code's maintainability, readability, and efficiency. Here are the suggested changes:

1. **Reduce Code Duplication in `append` Methods**: 
   Many `append` methods have a similar structure, especially for primitive types and their array counterparts. This repetitive pattern can be reduced using a generic method that handles the common logic.

2. **Use Primitive Wrappers in a More Efficient Way**:
   Calls like `Boolean.valueOf(lhs)` are unnecessary since autoboxing in Java will do this automatically. It can be replaced with just `lhs`.

3. **Simplify Null Checks**:
   Java's `Objects.requireNonNull` method is used to check if the parameters are null. This is good, but the custom error message like `"lhs"` or `"fieldName"` can be added to make the exception more informative.

4. **Potential Improvement in `SDiff` Class**:
   The `SDiff` class within `DiffBuilder` can be made static if it doesn't require access to the enclosing instance's members. This can improve the performance slightly by reducing the memory footprint.

5. **JavaDoc Improvements**:
   Some methods lack JavaDoc, or the existing documentation could be more informative. Improving JavaDoc helps with code maintainability and usability by other developers.

Here is the refactored code implementing the above suggestions:

```java
package org.apache.commons.lang3.builder;

// ... [imports remain unchanged]

public class DiffBuilder<T> implements Builder<DiffResult<T>> {
    // ... [class variables remain unchanged]

    // Refactored constructor and methods
    public DiffBuilder(final T lhs, final T rhs, final ToStringStyle style) {
        this(lhs, rhs, style, true);
    }

    // ... [other constructors and methods remain unchanged]

    // Generic method to handle append logic for all types
    private <F> DiffBuilder<T> appendGeneric(final String fieldName, final F lhs, final F rhs, final Function<F, ?> converter) {
        return objectsEquals || Objects.equals(lhs, rhs) ? this : add(fieldName, () -> converter.apply(lhs), () -> converter.apply(rhs), lhs.getClass());
    }

    // Refactored append methods for primitive types and arrays
    public DiffBuilder<T> append(final String fieldName, final boolean lhs, final boolean rhs) {
        return appendGeneric(fieldName, lhs, rhs, Function.identity());
    }

    public DiffBuilder<T> append(final String fieldName, final boolean[] lhs, final boolean[] rhs) {
        return appendGeneric(fieldName, lhs, rhs, ArrayUtils::toObject);
    }

    // ... [similar changes for other primitive types and their array counterparts]

    // Improved null checks
    private <F> DiffBuilder<T> add(final String fieldName, final Supplier<F> left, final Supplier<F> right, final Class<F> type) {
        Objects.requireNonNull(fieldName, "Field name cannot be null");
        diffs.add(new SDiff<>(fieldName, left, right, type));
        return this;
    }

    // ... [rest of the methods remain unchanged]

    // Static SDiff class if no access to enclosing instance is required
    private static final class SDiff<T> extends Diff<T> {
        // ... [implementation remains unchanged]
    }

    // ... [other methods and inner classes remain unchanged]
}

```

This refactoring focuses on the primary code structure and common practices. However, it's essential to ensure that the refactored code aligns with the overall design principles and performance considerations specific to the Apache Commons Lang library. It's also recommended to write unit tests to validate that the behavior of the code remains consistent after these changes.
