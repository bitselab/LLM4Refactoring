After reviewing the code, it appears that the attribute names are clear, meaningful, and consistent with their intended functionality. The names `details`, `certificates`, `privateKeySupplier`, and others are appropriately descriptive of the data they represent. These identifiers align well with the domain of SSL and PEM handling, making the code understandable for anyone familiar with this context.

However, there's a minor opportunity for renaming to enhance clarity:

- Rename `details` to `sslStoreDetails`: This provides a bit more context about what type of details these are, specifically relating to the SSL store.

Refactored Code with Renamed Attribute:

```java
package org.springframework.boot.ssl.pem;

import java.io.IOException;
import java.io.UncheckedIOException;
import java.security.PrivateKey;
import java.security.cert.X509Certificate;
import java.util.List;
import java.util.function.Supplier;

import org.springframework.util.Assert;
import org.springframework.util.CollectionUtils;
import org.springframework.util.function.SingletonSupplier;
import org.springframework.util.function.ThrowingSupplier;

final class LoadedPemSslStore implements PemSslStore {

    private final PemSslStoreDetails sslStoreDetails; // Renamed from 'details'

    private final Supplier<List<X509Certificate>> certificates;

    private final Supplier<PrivateKey> privateKeySupplier;

    LoadedPemSslStore(PemSslStoreDetails sslStoreDetails) { // Renamed parameter
        Assert.notNull(sslStoreDetails, "SSL Store Details must not be null"); // Updated message
        this.sslStoreDetails = sslStoreDetails; // Updated usage
        this.certificates = supplier(() -> loadCertificates(sslStoreDetails));
        this.privateKeySupplier = supplier(() -> loadPrivateKey(sslStoreDetails));
    }

    // ... [rest of the code remains unchanged]

    @Override
    public String type() {
        return this.sslStoreDetails.type(); // Updated usage
    }

    @Override
    public String alias() {
        return this.sslStoreDetails.alias(); // Updated usage
    }

    @Override
    public String password() {
        return this.sslStoreDetails.password(); // Updated usage
    }

    // ... [rest of the code remains unchanged]
}
```

This renaming provides a marginal improvement in clarity. However, it's important to note that the original code was already quite clear, and this change is more of a subtle enhancement than a necessary correction.
