 **Here are some refactoring opportunities identified in the code:**

1. **Inheritance Hierarchy:**
   - The comment `// TODO For 3.0, extend CountingInputStream. Or, add a max feature to CountingInputStream` suggests exploring a different inheritance structure.
   - Consider directly extending `CountingInputStream` or providing a `CountingInputStream` wrapper with the "max" feature rather than using composition. This could simplify the code.

2. **Builder Pattern:**
   - The class already utilizes a builder pattern, but it could be further simplified:
     - Remove the `maxLength` field in the builder and use `maxCount` directly.
     - Consider making `Builder` a static inner class of `BoundedInputStream` for better encapsulation.

3. **Deprecated Constructors:**
   - The deprecated constructors (`BoundedInputStream(final InputStream in)` and `BoundedInputStream(final InputStream inputStream, final long maxCount)`) could be removed if they're not actively used. This would make the code cleaner and less confusing for new developers.

4. **Redundant Code:**
   - The methods `getCount()` and `getByteCount()` essentially do the same thing. Consolidating them would reduce redundancy.
   - The `isMaxCount()` method could be simplified by directly accessing the `getCount()` method from `CountingInputStream`.

5. **Unused Method:**
   - The `onMaxLength()` method is marked as unused and seems to be intended for subclasses. If it's not actively used, it could be removed.

**Here's the refactored code incorporating these suggestions:**

```java
package org.apache.commons.io.input;

import static org.apache.commons.io.IOUtils.EOF;

import java.io.IOException;
import java.io.InputStream;

import org.apache.commons.io.build.AbstractStreamBuilder;
import org.apache.commons.io.input.CountingInputStream;

public class BoundedInputStream extends CountingInputStream {

    private final long maxCount;
    private final boolean propagateClose;

    private BoundedInputStream(final InputStream inputStream, final long maxCount, final boolean propagateClose) {
        super(inputStream);
        this.maxCount = maxCount;
        this.propagateClose = propagateClose;
    }

    public static Builder builder() {
        return new Builder();
    }

    public static class Builder extends AbstractStreamBuilder<BoundedInputStream, Builder> {

        private long maxCount = EOF;
        private boolean propagateClose = true;

        @Override
        public BoundedInputStream get() throws IOException {
            return new BoundedInputStream(getInputStream(), maxCount, propagateClose);
        }

        public Builder setMaxCount(final long maxCount) {
            this.maxCount = maxCount;
            return this;
        }

        public Builder setPropagateClose(final boolean propagateClose) {
            this.propagateClose = propagateClose;
            return this;
        }
    }

    // ... (rest of the methods with suggested simplifications)
}
```
