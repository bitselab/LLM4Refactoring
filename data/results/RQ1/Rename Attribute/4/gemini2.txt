No refactoring is necessary for the provided code snippet.

The code adheres to consistent naming conventions and uses clear variable names that reflect their purpose. The logic is well-structured and easy to follow. Additionally, there are comments throughout the code that explain complex sections, improving readability and maintainability.

However, here are some minor suggestions that could potentially improve the code:

1. Consider using descriptive names for anonymous inner classes like `UpdateLifecycleTaskExecutor` and `SetRolloverOnWriteTaskExecutor`. This can further enhance readability.
2. Explore potential opportunities to reduce code duplication. For instance, the logic for validating data streams (`validateDataStream`) and indices (`validateIndex`) seems similar. You could potentially refactor this into a reusable method.

Overall, the code is well-written and maintains good coding practices.
