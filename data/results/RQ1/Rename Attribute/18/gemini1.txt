Here are some refactoring opportunities in the provided code:

1. **Use guava library for Preconditions class:** The constructor and `withQueueSize` and `withThreadCount` methods can use the Preconditions class from the guava library to validate the input arguments. This will improve code readability and maintainability.

2. **Extract logic into separate methods:** The `sendUpdateStream` method is quite long and can be improved by extracting some logic into separate helper methods. This will make the code more readable and easier to test. For example, a separate method can be created to handle the logic of polling the queue and another method to handle sending the update request.

3. **Use a loop instead of recursion in `waitForEmptyQueue`:** The `waitForEmptyQueue` method uses recursion to wait for the queue to be empty. This can be refactored to use a loop instead, which can be more efficient.

4. **Consider using a ConcurrentLinkedQueue instead of a custom `CustomBlockingQueue`:** The code uses a custom `CustomBlockingQueue` class. Java already provides a `ConcurrentLinkedQueue` class that can be used for similar functionality. Consider using `ConcurrentLinkedQueue` instead of the custom implementation if it meets the requirements.

Here is an example of how the code can be refactored using the first suggestion:

```java
import com.google.common.base.Preconditions;

public class ConcurrentUpdateHttp2SolrClient extends SolrClient {
  // ... rest of the code

  public static class Builder {
    // ... rest of the code

    public Builder withQueueSize(int queueSize) {
      Preconditions.checkArgument(queueSize > 0, "queueSize must be a positive integer.");
      this.queueSize = queueSize;
      return this;
    }

    public Builder withThreadCount(int threadCount) {
      Preconditions.checkArgument(threadCount > 0, "threadCount must be a positive integer.");
      this.threadCount = threadCount;
      return this;
    }

    // ... rest of the code
  }
}
```

These are just a few suggestions, and other refactoring opportunities may exist depending on the specific needs of the project.
