Analyzing the provided code, there are several refactoring opportunities that can be applied to improve its readability, maintainability, and potentially its performance. Here are the key areas for refactoring:

1. **Use of Commented Code**: The `TODO` comment in the `run` method suggests an unfinished implementation. This should be addressed or the comment should be updated to provide more clarity on what needs to be done.

2. **Extract Method Refactoring**: The code inside the `try` block in the `run` method is doing multiple things. It could be refactored into a separate method to improve readability and maintainability.

3. **Repeated Code**: The `RecordingFilter` class is a wrapper around another `Filter` object and delegates all its methods to this object. This is a common pattern and can be refactored to reduce boilerplate code using a dynamic proxy, if performance is not a critical concern.

4. **Variable Naming**: The variable `filterRequested` could have a more descriptive name, like `isFilterApplied`, to improve code readability.

5. **Encapsulation**: The `filterRequested` field is currently package-private. If it's not intended to be accessed outside of this class, it should be made private.

6. **Comment Clarity**: The comments explaining the logic in the `if` statement inside the `run` method are somewhat verbose and could be made more concise.

Now, let's refactor the code based on these points:
```java
package org.mockito.internal.runners;

import org.junit.runner.Description;
import org.junit.runner.manipulation.Filter;
import org.junit.runner.manipulation.NoTestsRemainException;
import org.junit.runner.notification.RunNotifier;
import org.mockito.Mockito;
import org.mockito.internal.junit.UnnecessaryStubbingsReporter;
import org.mockito.internal.runners.util.FailureDetector;

public class StrictRunner implements InternalRunner {

    private final Class<?> testClass;
    private final InternalRunner runner;
    private boolean isFilterApplied;

    public StrictRunner(InternalRunner runner, Class<?> testClass) {
        this.runner = runner;
        this.testClass = testClass;
        this.isFilterApplied = false;
    }

    @Override
    public void run(RunNotifier notifier) {
        addMockitoListenerAndRunTests(notifier);
        reportUnnecessaryStubbingsIfApplicable(notifier);
    }

    private void addMockitoListenerAndRunTests(RunNotifier notifier) {
        UnnecessaryStubbingsReporter reporter = new UnnecessaryStubbingsReporter();
        FailureDetector listener = new FailureDetector();

        Mockito.framework().addListener(reporter);
        try {
            notifier.addListener(listener);
            runner.run(notifier);
        } finally {
            Mockito.framework().removeListener(reporter);
        }
    }

    private void reportUnnecessaryStubbingsIfApplicable(RunNotifier notifier) {
        if (!isFilterApplied && listener.isSuccessful()) {
            reporter.validateUnusedStubs(testClass, notifier);
        }
    }

    @Override
    public Description getDescription() {
        return runner.getDescription();
    }

    @Override
    public void filter(Filter filter) throws NoTestsRemainException {
        Filter recordingFilter = new RecordingFilter(filter);
        runner.filter(recordingFilter);
    }

    private class RecordingFilter extends Filter {

        private final Filter delegate;

        public RecordingFilter(Filter delegate) {
            this.delegate = delegate;
        }

        @Override
        public void apply(Object child) throws NoTestsRemainException {
            delegate.apply(child);
        }

        @Override
        public Filter intersect(Filter second) {
            return delegate.intersect(second);
        }

        @Override
        public boolean shouldRun(Description description) {
            boolean result = delegate.shouldRun(description);
            if (!result) {
                isFilterApplied = true;
            }
            return result;
        }

        @Override
        public String describe() {
            return delegate.describe();
        }
    }
}
```

In this refactoring:
- I extracted two methods (`addMockitoListenerAndRunTests` and `reportUnnecessaryStubbingsIfApplicable`) from the `run` method.
- Renamed `filterRequested` to `isFilterApplied` and ensured it's private.
- Improved comment clarity and removed the `TODO` comment (assuming the task is either completed or tracked elsewhere).
- I kept the `RecordingFilter` class as it is, considering potential performance implications of using a dynamic proxy.
