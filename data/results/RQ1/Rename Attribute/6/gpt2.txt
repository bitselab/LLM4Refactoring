In the provided code snippet, focusing specifically on attribute renaming for clarity and readability, several opportunities can be identified. Renaming attributes is essential for maintaining clear, understandable code, especially in a complex system like Apache Hadoop. Here are the suggested renamings:

1. **`clientIdMsb` and `clientIdLsb` in `CacheEntry`**: These variables represent the most significant bytes and least significant bytes of the client ID. They could be renamed to `clientIdMostSigBytes` and `clientIdLeastSigBytes` for better readability.

2. **`state` in `CacheEntry`**: This variable could be more descriptive. Renaming it to `requestState` or `processingState` would better convey its purpose.

3. **`INPROGRESS`, `SUCCESS`, `FAILED` in `CacheEntry`**: These constants are clear, but following Java naming conventions, they should be renamed to `STATE_IN_PROGRESS`, `STATE_SUCCESS`, and `STATE_FAILED`.

4. **`lock` in `RetryCache`**: This variable could be more descriptive. Renaming it to `cacheLock` would better reflect its purpose of locking the cache operations.

5. **`set` in `RetryCache`**: This variable name is very generic. A more descriptive name like `cacheEntries` would better indicate its role as a container for cache entries.

6. **`LOG`**: While `LOG` is a standard name for loggers, it could be more descriptive, like `RETRY_CACHE_LOGGER`, to clarify its specific role.

Here is the refactored code with these renaming changes applied:

```java
package org.apache.hadoop.ipc;

// ... [other imports]

@InterfaceAudience.Private
public class RetryCache {
    public static final Logger RETRY_CACHE_LOGGER = LoggerFactory.getLogger(RetryCache.class);
    private final RetryCacheMetrics retryCacheMetrics;
    private static final int MAX_CAPACITY = 16;

    // ... [other parts of the RetryCache class]

    public static class CacheEntry implements LightWeightCache.Entry {
        private static final byte STATE_IN_PROGRESS = 0;
        private static final byte STATE_SUCCESS = 1;
        private static final byte STATE_FAILED = 2;

        private byte processingState = STATE_IN_PROGRESS;

        private final long clientIdMostSigBytes;
        private final long clientIdLeastSigBytes;
        // ... [rest of the CacheEntry class]

        CacheEntry(byte[] clientId, int callId, long expirationTime) {
            // ... [implementation]
            clientIdMostSigBytes = ClientId.getMsb(clientId);
            clientIdLeastSigBytes = ClientId.getLsb(clientId);
            // ... [rest of the constructor]
        }

        // ... [other methods of CacheEntry]
    }

    // ... [CacheEntryWithPayload class]

    private final LightWeightGSet<CacheEntry, CacheEntry> cacheEntries;
    private final long expirationTime;
    private final String cacheName;
    private final ReentrantLock cacheLock = new ReentrantLock();

    // ... [rest of the RetryCache class]

    // ... [other methods]
}
```

These changes aim to make the code more readable and self-explanatory, which is particularly important in a large and complex codebase like Apache Hadoop's. Remember, renaming should be done carefully to avoid breaking changes, especially if the codebase is widely used or part of a larger system.
