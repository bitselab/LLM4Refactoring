 **I've identified several potential refactoring opportunities within the code:**

1. **Encapsulate Locking:**
   - Create a synchronized wrapper for `CacheEntry` to encapsulate its locking logic instead of using `synchronized` blocks directly.
   - Consider using a lock object specifically for the cache to manage concurrency more efficiently.

2. **Introduce Null Objects:**
   - Replace frequent null checks with null objects that provide default behaviors.
   - This simplifies code and reduces conditional branching.

3. **Combine State Handling:**
   - Consolidate the logic for handling cache entry states into a single method for better readability and maintainability.

4. **Extract Repeated Logic:**
   - Refactor common code blocks into separate helper methods to reduce duplication and promote code reuse.

5. **Consider Builder Pattern:**
   - Utilize the builder pattern for constructing `CacheEntry` objects to make the creation process more readable and flexible.

6. **Revisit Class Hierarchy:**
   - Evaluate whether further class extraction or refactoring could enhance code organization and maintainability.

**Here's a refactored code snippet incorporating some of these suggestions:**

```java
// Synchronizing logic encapsulated within CacheEntry wrapper
class SynchronizedCacheEntry {
    private final CacheEntry entry;
    private final Lock lock = new ReentrantLock();

    // ... (methods for accessing and modifying entry state with locking)
}

// ...

private SynchronizedCacheEntry waitForCompletion(CacheEntry newEntry) {
    // ...
    SynchronizedCacheEntry mapEntry = new SynchronizedCacheEntry(set.get(newEntry));
    // ...
}

// ...
```

**While these refactoring steps can enhance code clarity, maintainability, and potentially performance, it's crucial to assess any modifications within the context of the application's requirements and constraints. Thorough testing is always recommended after refactoring.**
