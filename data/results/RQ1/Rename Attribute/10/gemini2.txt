No refactoring is necessary in this context.

The variable names used in the code snippet (`true` and `false`) are already clear and concise. They accurately reflect the boolean values they represent (including types in the output or not). 

While renaming attributes to more descriptive terms can generally improve readability, in this case, `true` and `false` are standard boolean values and their meaning is universally understood by programmers. 

If the logic behind these booleans became more complex in the future, then refactoring to a more descriptive name might be beneficial. However, for the current purpose, the existing variable names are perfectly adequate.
