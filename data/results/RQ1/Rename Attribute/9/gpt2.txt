Renaming attributes in a codebase is a crucial refactoring step aimed at improving code readability and maintainability. After reviewing the provided code snippet, I've identified several attributes that could benefit from renaming for clarity and better understanding. Here are the suggested changes:

1. **Rename `LOG` to `logger`**: The `LOG` static variable could be renamed to `logger` for better readability and adherence to Java naming conventions.
   
2. **Rename `ROOT_CHANGES_LOGGER` to `rootChangesLogger`**: Similarly, `ROOT_CHANGES_LOGGER` can be renamed to `rootChangesLogger` for consistency and readability.

3. **Rename `tracker` to `reindexTracker`**: The attribute `tracker` is somewhat vague. Renaming it to `reindexTracker` or something similar would provide more context about its purpose.

4. **Rename `indexDependencies` to `shouldIndexDependencies`**: The boolean `indexDependencies` sounds like a method name. Renaming it to `shouldIndexDependencies` would clarify that it's a flag.

5. **Rename `builders` to `iteratorBuilders`**: The name `builders` is quite generic. Renaming it to `iteratorBuilders` would provide more information about what kind of builders these are.

6. **Rename `entities` to `workspaceEntities`**: The variable `entities` in the context of `WorkspaceEntitiesRootsChangedRescanningInfo` could be more descriptive. Renaming it to `workspaceEntities` would be clearer.

7. **Rename `references` to `entityPointers`**: In `WorkspaceEntitiesRootsChangedRescanningInfo`, `references` might be better named as `entityPointers` for clarity.

8. **Rename `change` to `rescanningChange`**: The variable `change` used in loops for `RootsChangeRescanningInfo` objects could be more descriptive. `rescanningChange` might be a better name.

9. **Rename `newBuilders` to `iteratorBuildersForChange`**: The variable `newBuilders` in `collectIteratorBuildersOnChange` is vague. A name like `iteratorBuildersForChange` would be more descriptive.

10. **Rename `uncheckedProvider` to `indexableEntityProvider`**: In `collectIEPIteratorsOnChange`, renaming `uncheckedProvider` to `indexableEntityProvider` would make it clearer what type of provider is being referenced.

Here's a portion of the refactored code with the suggested attribute renaming:

```java
// ... [Imports and package declaration]

final class EntityIndexingServiceImpl implements EntityIndexingServiceEx {
    private static final Logger logger = Logger.getInstance(EntityIndexingServiceImpl.class);
    private static final RootChangesLogger rootChangesLogger = new RootChangesLogger();
    @NotNull
    private final CustomEntitiesCausingReindexTracker reindexTracker = new CustomEntitiesCausingReindexTracker();

    // ... [Other methods]

    private static void doIndexChanges(@NotNull Project project, @NotNull List<? extends RootsChangeRescanningInfo> changes) {
        boolean shouldIndexDependencies = false;
        for (RootsChangeRescanningInfo rescanningChange : changes) {
            // ... [Rest of the method implementation]
        }
    }

    // ... [Rest of the class with renamed attributes]
}
```

This refactoring focuses mainly on renaming attributes for improved clarity. Depending on the broader context of the application, there might be other areas where renaming could also be beneficial.
