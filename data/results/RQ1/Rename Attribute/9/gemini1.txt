## Refactoring Opportunities in the Provided Code

Here are some refactoring opportunities in the provided code:

1. **Extract Method:** 
    - The logic for processing different change types (`Change.Added`, `Change.Replaced`, and `Change.Removed`) in several methods can be extracted into separate methods to improve readability and maintainability. 
    - For example, a method named `handleEntityChange` could be created to encapsulate this logic, taking the change type, old entity, new entity, project, builder collection, and other necessary parameters.

2. **Reduce Cyclomatic Complexity:**
    - The `collectIteratorBuildersOnChange` method contains nested conditional statements that increase its cyclomatic complexity. Consider refactoring this method to use a strategy pattern where different concrete strategies handle specific change types. This can improve readability and maintainability.

3. **Descriptive Variable Names:**
    - Some variable names like `builders`, `descriptionsBuilder`, and `uncheckedProvider` could be improved to be more descriptive. Consider using names that better reflect their purpose in the code.

4. **Early return:**
    - In the `doIndexChanges` method, there are several checks that can be refactored to use early returns to improve code flow and readability.

5. **Introduce Local Variables:**
    - Long expressions within conditional statements can be broken down into smaller, local variables to enhance readability.

## Refactored Code Snippet (Example)

Here's an example of the refactored code with the first suggestion implemented:

```java
private static void collectIteratorBuildersOnChange(Change change, 
                                                   @Nullable E oldEntity, 
                                                   @Nullable E newEntity, 
                                                   @NotNull Project project, 
                                                   @NotNull Collection<? super IndexableIteratorBuilder> builders, 
                                                   @NotNull WorkspaceIndexingRootsBuilder descriptionsBuilder, 
                                                   @NotNull EntityStorage entityStorage) {
  LOG.assertTrue(newEntity != null || change == Change.Removed, "New entity " + newEntity + ", change " + change);
  LOG.assertTrue(oldEntity != null || change == Change.Added, "Old entity " + oldEntity + ", change " + change);

  handleEntityChange(change, oldEntity, newEntity, project, builders, descriptionsBuilder, entityStorage);
}

private static void handleEntityChange(Change change, 
                                       @Nullable E oldEntity, 
                                       @Nullable E newEntity, 
                                       @NotNull Project project, 
                                       @NotNull Collection<? super IndexableIteratorBuilder> builders, 
                                       @NotNull WorkspaceIndexingRootsBuilder descriptionsBuilder, 
                                       @NotNull EntityStorage entityStorage) {
  // Implement logic based on change type (Added, Replaced, Removed)
  // using oldEntity, newEntity, project, builders, etc.
  // ...
}
```

These are just a few examples, and further improvements can be made based on specific coding standards and preferences. Remember to apply these changes throughout the codebase consistently.
