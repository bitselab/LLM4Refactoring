Refactoring is a key part of software development, aimed at improving code readability, maintainability, and performance without altering its functionality. After reviewing the provided code snippet, here are some refactoring suggestions:

1. **Extract Methods for Repeated Code**: There are several instances where similar blocks of code are repeated, such as the processing of different types of `RootsChangeRescanningInfo` changes. Extracting these into separate methods would increase readability and maintainability.

2. **Use of Enums and Switch Statements**: The method `collectIteratorBuildersOnChange` uses a series of `if-else` conditions to handle different types of changes (`Added`, `Replaced`, `Removed`). This could be refactored into a `switch` statement for better readability.

3. **Extracting Large Methods**: The method `doIndexChanges` is quite long and handles multiple responsibilities. It could be broken down into smaller methods, each handling a specific aspect of the indexing changes.

4. **Improve Logging and Error Handling**: The logging statements are scattered and varied. Standardizing these and implementing a more consistent error-handling strategy could improve the codeâ€™s robustness and debuggability.

5. **Optimizing Imports and Dependencies**: There are a lot of imported classes and packages. Reviewing and removing any unused imports would clean up the code.

6. **Refactor Conditional Expressions**: Some conditional expressions, especially within loops, are complex and could be refactored for clarity.

7. **Comments and Documentation**: While the code contains some comments, certain complex sections could benefit from more detailed explanations to aid future maintainability.

8. **Modularization**: If certain parts of the code are logically grouped but spread across the file, consider modularizing these into separate classes or packages.

Here is a refactored snippet focusing on some of these suggestions:

```java
// ... [Imports and package declaration]

final class EntityIndexingServiceImpl implements EntityIndexingServiceEx {
    // ... [Class level declarations]

    @Override
    public void indexChanges(@NotNull Project project, @NotNull List<? extends RootsChangeRescanningInfo> changes) {
        if (shouldReturnEarly(project, changes)) return;
        processIndexChanges(project, changes);
    }

    private boolean shouldReturnEarly(@NotNull Project project, @NotNull List<? extends RootsChangeRescanningInfo> changes) {
        // Consolidated early return conditions
        return !(FileBasedIndex.getInstance() instanceof FileBasedIndexImpl) ||
               LightEdit.owns(project) ||
               !UnindexedFilesScanner.isFirstProjectScanningRequested(project) ||
               changes.isEmpty();
    }

    private void processIndexChanges(@NotNull Project project, @NotNull List<? extends RootsChangeRescanningInfo> changes) {
        // Refactored content of the original doIndexChanges method
    }

    // ... [Other refactored methods]
}
```

This refactoring focuses on improving readability and maintainability. Depending on the broader context of the application and its performance profile, further refactoring could be necessary.
