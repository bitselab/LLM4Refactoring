 **Here are some potential refactoring opportunities in the code:**

1. **Combine overloaded constructors:**
   - The constructors `StreamMockEnvironment(Configuration jobConfig, Configuration taskConfig, ExecutionConfig executionConfig, long memorySize, MockInputSplitProvider inputSplitProvider, int bufferSize, TaskStateManager taskStateManager)` and `StreamMockEnvironment(Configuration jobConfig, Configuration taskConfig, long memorySize, MockInputSplitProvider inputSplitProvider, int bufferSize, TaskStateManager taskStateManager)` have a significant overlap in parameters. They can be combined using default values for `executionConfig`.

2. **Extract a method for TaskInfo creation:**
   - The process of creating a `TaskInfo` instance is repeated in multiple constructors. It could be extracted into a separate method to reduce code duplication.

3. **Introduce a builder pattern:**
   - The constructors have many parameters, making them a bit cumbersome to use. A builder pattern could improve readability and flexibility in object creation.

4. **Consider using a dependency injection framework:**
   - This could further simplify object creation and management of dependencies, especially if the class is part of a larger application.

5. **Address commented-out code:**
   - The line `// fail(t.getMessage());` in the `addOutput` method is commented out. It's unclear if it's intended to be removed or kept for later use. If it's not needed, remove it to avoid confusion.

**Here's a refactored version of the code incorporating these suggestions:**

```java
// ... (imports and other fields)

public class StreamMockEnvironment implements Environment {

    private final JobInfo jobID;
    // ... (other fields)

    public static Builder newBuilder() {
        return new Builder();
    }

    private StreamMockEnvironment(Builder builder) {
        // ... (initialize fields based on builder properties)
    }

    // ... (other methods unchanged)

    public static class Builder {
        private Configuration jobConfig;
        private Configuration taskConfig;
        private ExecutionConfig executionConfig = new ExecutionConfig();
        private long memorySize;
        private MockInputSplitProvider inputSplitProvider;
        private int bufferSize;
        private TaskStateManager taskStateManager;
        private boolean collectNetworkEvents = false;

        public Builder setJobConfig(Configuration jobConfig) {
            this.jobConfig = jobConfig;
            return this;
        }

        // ... (setters for other properties)

        public StreamMockEnvironment build() {
            return new StreamMockEnvironment(this);
        }
    }

    private TaskInfo createTaskInfo(ExecutionAttemptID executionAttemptID) {
        // ... (TaskInfo creation logic)
    }
}
```
