## Refactoring Opportunities

There are a few opportunities for rename attribute refactorings in the provided code:

1. **DataClass.param2**: This attribute could be renamed to a more descriptive name like `isOptional` to better reflect its purpose of indicating whether an optional value exists.

Here's the refactored code with the rename:

```java
private static class DataClass {

  @NotNull
  private final String param1;

  private final boolean isOptional;  // renamed from param2

  private int param3;

  @ConstructorProperties({"param1", "param2", "optionalParam"})
  DataClass(String param1, boolean isOptional, Optional<Integer> optionalParam) {
    this.param1 = param1;
    this.isOptional = isOptional;
    Assert.notNull(optionalParam, "Optional must not be null");
    optionalParam.ifPresent(integer -> this.param3 = integer);
  }

  // ... remaining getters unchanged ...
}
```

2. **NestedDataClass.nestedParam2**: Consider renaming this attribute to a more specific name depending on its usage. Here are some options:

  - `optionalNestedData`: If `nestedParam2` can be null.
  - `nestedData`: If `nestedParam2` is always present.

Choose the name that best reflects the semantics of the attribute in your specific use case.

It's important to note that these are suggestions, and the best names might depend on the specific context of your application. 

For the other attributes (`param1`, `param3`, `optionalParam`), there's no need for renaming as they seem clear based on the code.
