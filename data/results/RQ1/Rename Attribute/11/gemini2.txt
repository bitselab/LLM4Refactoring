## Refactoring Opportunity: Attribute Renaming

The attribute named `classLoader` can be renamed to a more descriptive name that reflects its purpose. Currently, "classLoader" is generic and doesn't explicitly state what type of class loader it is or what it's used for.

Here's the refactored code with the renamed attribute:

```java
public class WebSocketCoreClient extends ContainerLifeCycle {
  // ... other code ...

  private final ClassLoader contextClassLoader;

  public WebSocketCoreClient() {
    this(null, new WebSocketComponents());
  }

  // ... other constructors and methods ...

  public ClassLoader getContextClassLoader() {
    return contextClassLoader;
  }

  public void setContextClassLoader(ClassLoader classLoader) {
    this.contextClassLoader = Objects.requireNonNull(classLoader);
  }

  // ... other code ...
}
```

In this refactoring, `classLoader` is renamed to `contextClassLoader`. This name clarifies that this attribute holds the ClassLoader used for loading classes within the context of this WebSocketCoreClient instance.
