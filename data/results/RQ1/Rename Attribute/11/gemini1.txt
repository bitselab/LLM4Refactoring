 **Here are some refactoring opportunities I identified in the code:**

**1. Constructor Chaining and Initialization:**

- Consider chaining the constructors to reduce redundant initialization logic.
- Potentially move the validation and setup of `httpClient` and `components` to a private initialization method to make the constructors more concise.

**2. Builder Pattern for Complex Construction:**

- If the constructors become more complex due to additional configuration options, consider using the Builder pattern to provide a fluent interface for creation.

**3. Dependency Injection:**

- Explore using dependency injection to manage the `httpClient` and `webSocketComponents` dependencies, potentially reducing the need for multiple constructors and configuration logic within the class.

**4. Simplifying Conditional Logic:**

- The logic for creating `WebSocketComponents` could be simplified by using conditional initialization within a single constructor.

**5. Logging:**

- Consider using a logger for the class instead of a static logger field for better separation of concerns.

**6. Encapsulation:**

- The `components` object is exposed publicly, but its internal methods are only used within the class. Consider making those methods private to improve encapsulation.

**Here's a refactored version incorporating some of these suggestions:**

```java
public class WebSocketCoreClient extends ContainerLifeCycle {

    private final HttpClient httpClient;
    private final WebSocketComponents components;
    private ClassLoader classLoader;

    private WebSocketCoreClient(HttpClient httpClient, WebSocketComponents components) {
        this.httpClient = httpClient;
        this.components = components;
        initialize();
        classLoader = Thread.currentThread().getContextClassLoader();
    }

    public WebSocketCoreClient() {
        this(null, null);
    }

    public WebSocketCoreClient(WebSocketComponents webSocketComponents) {
        this(null, webSocketComponents);
    }

    private void initialize() {
        addBean(httpClient);
        addBean(components);
        // ... other initialization logic
    }

    // ... other methods
}
```
