Analyzing the provided code for potential rename attribute refactorings, the goal is to improve the clarity and readability of attribute names. Here are some suggestions:

1. **Rename `importFullPath` to `fullImportPath`:** This name change makes it clearer that the variable stores the complete path of an import.

2. **Rename `importGroup` to `groupOfImport`:** This change helps clarify that this variable represents the group to which an import belongs.

3. **Rename `staticImport` to `isStaticImport`:** This renaming follows the common convention for boolean variables, indicating that it's a flag checking if an import is static.

4. **Rename `importAST` to `importAstNode`:** This is to clarify that the variable is an AST (Abstract Syntax Tree) node representing an import.

5. **Rename `matchPosition` and `matchLength` in `RuleMatchForImport`:** These could be renamed to `matchingPosition` and `matchingLength` respectively for better clarity.

6. **Rename `customOrderRules` to `importOrderRules`:** This name is more descriptive of what the variable actually holds.

7. **Rename `importToGroupList` to `importDetailsList`:** This name better represents the content of the list - details of each import.

8. **Rename `samePackageDomainsRegExp` to `samePackagePattern`:** This change makes it clearer that this variable holds a pattern (regex) related to the same package.

9. **Rename `standardPackageRegExp`, `thirdPartyPackageRegExp`, `specialImportsRegExp` to `standardPackagePattern`, `thirdPartyPackagePattern`, `specialImportsPattern`:** Similar to the above, these renames make it clearer that these are regex patterns.

10. **Rename `separateLineBetweenGroups` to `isEmptyLineRequiredBetweenGroups`:** This renaming makes the purpose of the variable more explicit.

I will now refactor the code with these changes for improved clarity.

After reviewing the code snippet provided, I've identified several attributes that could be renamed to improve readability and clarity. Here are the refactored attribute names along with the modified code:

1. `importFullPath` to `fullImportPath` - to more accurately describe that it's the complete path of the import.
2. `importGroup` to `importCategory` - to better reflect that this represents the category or type of import.
3. `staticImport` to `isStaticImport` - to adhere to the boolean naming convention, indicating it's a state.
4. `importAST` to `importAstNode` - to clarify that it's an AST (Abstract Syntax Tree) node.
5. `customOrderRules` to `orderedImportRules` - to more clearly represent the rules for import ordering.
6. `importToGroupList` to `importDetailsList` - to more accurately describe the list containing details of imports.
7. `samePackageDomainsRegExp`, `standardPackageRegExp`, `thirdPartyPackageRegExp`, `specialImportsRegExp` to `samePackagePattern`, `standardPackagePattern`, `thirdPartyPackagePattern`, `specialImportsPattern` respectively - to clarify that these are regex patterns.
8. `separateLineBetweenGroups` to `isSeparateLineBetweenGroups` - to follow the boolean naming convention.
9. `samePackageMatchingDepth` to `packageDepthForSameGroup` - to better describe the purpose of this variable.

Here's the modified code snippet with the renamed attributes:

```java
// ... [previous code remains unchanged]

private final List<ImportDetails> importDetailsList = new ArrayList<>();

private String samePackagePattern = "";

private Pattern standardPackagePattern = Pattern.compile("^(java|javax)\\.");
private Pattern thirdPartyPackagePattern = Pattern.compile(".*");
private Pattern specialImportsPattern = Pattern.compile("^$");

private boolean isSeparateLineBetweenGroups = true;

private boolean sortImportsInGroupAlphabetically;

private int packageDepthForSameGroup = 2;

// ... [setter methods and other methods remain unchanged]

@Override
public void visitToken(DetailAST ast) {
    if (ast.getType() == TokenTypes.PACKAGE_DEF) {
        samePackagePattern = createSamePackageRegexp(packageDepthForSameGroup, ast);
    }
    else {
        final String fullImportPath = getFullImportIdent(ast);
        final boolean isStatic = ast.getType() == TokenTypes.STATIC_IMPORT;
        importDetailsList.add(new ImportDetails(fullImportPath,
                getImportGroup(isStatic, fullImportPath), isStatic, ast));
    }
}

// ... [other methods remain unchanged]

private static final class ImportDetails {
    private final String fullImportPath;
    private final String importCategory;
    private final boolean isStaticImport;
    private final DetailAST importAstNode;

    private ImportDetails(String fullImportPath, String importCategory, boolean isStaticImport,
                          DetailAST importAstNode) {
        this.fullImportPath = fullImportPath;
        this.importCategory = importCategory;
        this.isStaticImport = isStaticImport;
        this.importAstNode = importAstNode;
    }

    // ... [getter methods remain unchanged]
}

// ... [remaining code remains unchanged]
```

This refactoring focuses on improving the clarity of attribute names, making the code more readable and maintainable.
