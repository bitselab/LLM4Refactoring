The provided code snippet demonstrates a well-structured and organized class with good separation of concerns. Here's a breakdown of the observations for potential refactorings:

1. **Meaningful Variable Names:** While the current variable names are understandable, some could be improved for better readability. Consider renaming variables like:
    - `customImportOrderRules` to `customImportOrderGroups`
    - `importToGroupList` to `importsByGroup`
    - `NON_GROUP_RULE_GROUP` to `UNASSIGNED_GROUP`
    - `STATIC_RULE_GROUP` to `STATIC_IMPORT_GROUP`
    - Similarly, rename other group names for clarity (e.g., `SAME_PACKAGE_RULE_GROUP`, `THIRD_PARTY_PACKAGE_RULE_GROUP`)

2. **Extract Method:** The logic within `findBetterPatternMatch` can potentially be extracted into a separate method for improved readability, especially as it involves multiple comparisons and conditional statements.

3. **Consider Using Enums:** The hardcoded group names (`STATIC_RULE_GROUP`, etc.) could be refactored into an enum for better type safety and maintainability. This would also allow for easier extension of future groups.

4. **Comments:** While the code includes comments explaining the functionality, some sections could benefit from additional comments to clarify complex logic or non-obvious parts.

Overall, the code is well-written and functions well. The suggested refactorings are primarily for readability and maintainability improvements.
