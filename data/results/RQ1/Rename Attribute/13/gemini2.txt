 **I've identified several opportunities for rename attribute refactorings in the code you provided:**

1. **Rename `dir` to `tempDir`:** 
 - This change improves clarity by explicitly conveying the variable's purpose as a temporary directory.
 - Apply this change consistently throughout the `TempDirectory` class and `CloseablePath` class.

2. **Rename `fileOperations` to `fileDeleter` or `fileCleanupOperations`:** 
 - This rename offers a more descriptive name, accurately reflecting its role in file deletion and cleanup.
  - Apply this change within the `CloseablePath` class.

3. **Rename `KEY` to `TEMP_DIR_KEY`:** 
 - This rename makes the key constant's purpose more explicit, enhancing readability.
  - Apply this change within the `TempDirectory` class.

4. **Rename `EMPTY` to `NO_CLEANUP`:** 
- This change uses a more descriptive name for the `CleanupMode` enum value, better aligning with its meaning.
  - Apply this change within the `CleanupMode` enum.

5. **Rename `Namespace` to `TempDirectoryNamespace`:** 
- This rename differentiates the namespace for this specific extension, improving code organization and avoiding potential conflicts.
  - Apply this change to the `Namespace` class and its usage within the `TempDirectory` class.

**Additional Considerations:**
- **Consider renaming `Scope` to `TempDirScope`** for consistency and clarity.
- **Review any custom method and variable names for potential renames** that could enhance readability and maintainability.
- **Apply refactorings systematically and with careful testing** to ensure code functionality remains intact.

**Incorporating these rename attribute refactorings can make the code more self-explanatory and easier to comprehend for other developers.**
