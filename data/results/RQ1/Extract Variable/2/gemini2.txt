There are two opportunities for Extract Variable refactoring in the provided code snippet:

1. Extracting the creation of the `helloWorld` byte array:

This byte array is created multiple times throughout the test cases. We can extract its creation into a separate variable with a descriptive name like `testData`.

```java
@Test
public void testOnMaxLength() throws Exception {
  final byte[] testData = "Hello World".getBytes();
  // ... rest of the code using testData ...
}
```

2. Extracting the creation of the `hello` byte array (optional):

Similar to the previous point, the `hello` byte array is created a few times. While not used as extensively as `helloWorld`, it can also be refactored for better readability.

```java
@Test
public void testOnMaxLength() throws Exception {
  final byte[] testData = "Hello World".getBytes();
  final byte[] shortData = "Hello".getBytes();
  // ... rest of the code using testData and shortData ...
}
```

By applying these refactorings, the code becomes more concise and easier to maintain.
