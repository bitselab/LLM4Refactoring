## Refactored Code with Extract Variable

There is an opportunity for extract variable refactoring in the `createHttpHandler` method. The condition `StringUtils.hasLength(this.contextPath)` is used twice. We can extract this condition into a separate variable to improve readability.

Here's the refactored code:

```java
@Override
protected HttpHandler createHttpHandler() {
  HttpHandler handler = super.createHttpHandler();
  // Extract the condition into a variable
  boolean hasContextPath = StringUtils.hasLength(this.contextPath);
  if (hasContextPath) {
    handler = Handlers.path().addPrefixPath(this.contextPath, handler);
  }
  return handler;
}
```

This refactoring makes the code easier to understand by clearly separating the condition check from the actual logic.
