No refactoring is necessary for the provided code snippet.

The code utilizes repetitive expressions for parsing time zones with different locales. However, these repeated expressions are unlikely to benefit from being refactored into separate variables. 

Here's why refactoring might not be ideal in this case:

1. **Readability:** The current approach maintains readability as the purpose of each code block is clear. Extracting variables might introduce unnecessary complexity.

2. **Maintainability:**  Isolating these expressions wouldn't significantly improve maintainability. The logic related to parsing time zones remains within the same methods.

3. **Duplication is Limited:** The duplication is contained within specific methods (`testTimeZoneStrategyPattern_DateFormatSymbols_getZoneStrings` and  `testTimeZoneStrategyPattern_TimeZone_getAvailableIDs`). It's not pervasive throughout the codebase.

Therefore, the current approach might be considered a trade-off between code duplication and readability/maintainability.
