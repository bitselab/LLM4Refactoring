Here are some potential refactoring opportunities in the code snippet you provided:

**1. Reduce Code Duplication:**

* The `initHeaders` and `initCookies` methods in `DefaultRequestBodyUriSpec` are very similar. They both check if the default values are present and then add them to the output. This can be refactored into a single method that takes a `Map` argument and checks if it's empty before adding it.

* The `handleBodyMono` and `handleBodyFlux` methods in `DefaultResponseSpec` share a lot of logic. They both handle errors using `onErrorResume` and call `applyStatusHandlers`. This can be refactored into a single private method that takes the body (`Mono<T>` or `Flux<T>`) and applies the common logic.

**2. Improve Readability:**

* The `exceptionWrappingFunction` in `DefaultResponseSpec` creates a function that wraps an exception thrown during body processing with the exception from the `ClientResponse`. This logic can be made clearer by using a lambda expression directly in the `onErrorResume` call.

* The `toStatusCodePredicate` method in `DefaultResponseSpec` converts an `IntPredicate` to a `Predicate<HttpStatusCode>`. This can be simplified by using a method reference like `HttpStatusCode::value` in the lambda expression.

**3. Leverage Existing Libraries:**

* The code uses a custom `AtomicBoolean` to track if a response has been received in `DefaultRequestBodyUriSpec.exchange`. This functionality can be achieved using the `doOnNext` operator of `Mono` to set a flag in the context.

**4. Consider Alternatives:**

* The code uses a custom `ClientRequestObservationContext` class to store information about the request. This might be better suited for an `Immutable` data holder class with builder methods.

These are just some suggestions, and the best approach will depend on the specific context and coding style preferences.
