The provided code demonstrates a well-structured and organized approach to handling serializable `Type` variants. There are minimal refactoring opportunities due to the well-defined responsibilities of each class and method. However, there are a few minor improvements to consider:

1. **Reduce Code Duplication in `TypeProxyInvocationHandler`:**  
The `invoke` method has logic for handling both `getType` and methods returning `Type[]`. This functionality could be extracted into a separate helper method to reduce redundancy.

2. **Consider Alternative for Caching Mechanism:**  
The code uses a `ConcurrentReferenceHashMap` for caching `Type` proxies. While this is a valid approach, you might explore alternative caching mechanisms like Caffeine or Guava Cache that offer more granular control over cache invalidation and expiration strategies.

These are minor suggestions, and the current implementation is well-structured and functional.
