Upon reviewing the provided code, I identified several opportunities for refactoring to improve maintainability, readability, and potentially performance. The refactoring suggestions are as follows:

1. **Extract Method**: Several methods in this class are quite long and perform multiple tasks. For instance, `processFiles`, `processFile`, and `setupChild` can be broken down into smaller methods. This will enhance readability and make the code more maintainable.

2. **Avoid Deep Nesting**: The method `processFiles` has deep nesting. It's a good practice to reduce nesting for better readability. This can be achieved by early returns or breaking down the method.

3. **Use More Descriptive Variable Names**: Some variable names, such as `fsc` in the `processFiles` method, could be more descriptive to improve code readability.

4. **Reduce Code Duplication**: The `fireErrors` method has some duplicated code that could be refactored into a separate method. This will follow the DRY (Don't Repeat Yourself) principle.

5. **Improve Exception Handling**: The generic `catch (Exception ex)` and `catch (Error error)` blocks in `processFiles` can be improved. It's better to catch specific exceptions and handle them appropriately.

6. **Use of Java 8 Features**: There are opportunities to use Java 8 features, such as `Optional`, which can handle `null` values more cleanly, and stream API enhancements for collections.

7. **Improve Commenting**: Some comments are overly verbose or not necessary. Refactoring comments to be more concise and meaningful would improve the code's readability.

8. **Encapsulate Fields**: Some fields could be better encapsulated. For instance, making them private and providing getter/setter methods if external access is required.

9. **Reduce Class Size**: The `Checker` class is quite large. Consider breaking it into smaller classes, each with a single responsibility. This adheres to the Single Responsibility Principle.

10. **Refactor Conditional Statements**: In methods like `setFileExtensions`, the conditional logic can be streamlined for better clarity.

I will now refactor the code with these considerations. This process involves breaking down complex methods, improving naming, handling exceptions more precisely, and other improvements as outlined. Let's proceed with the refactoring.

Given the length and complexity of the code, I'll refactor a portion of it to demonstrate the suggested improvements. Let's focus on the `processFiles` method as an example. I'll refactor it to reduce complexity, improve readability, and handle exceptions more precisely.

Original `processFiles` Method:
```java
private void processFiles(List<File> files) throws CheckstyleException {
    for (final File file : files) {
        String fileName = null;
        try {
            fileName = file.getAbsolutePath();
            final long timestamp = file.lastModified();
            if (cacheFile != null && cacheFile.isInCache(fileName, timestamp)
                    || !acceptFileStarted(fileName)) {
                continue;
            }
            if (cacheFile != null) {
                cacheFile.put(fileName, timestamp);
            }
            fireFileStarted(fileName);
            final SortedSet<Violation> fileMessages = processFile(file);
            fireErrors(fileName, fileMessages);
            fireFileFinished(fileName);
        }
        // catch blocks...
    }
}
```

Refactored `processFiles` Method:
```java
private void processFiles(List<File> files) throws CheckstyleException {
    for (final File file : files) {
        processSingleFile(file);
    }
}

private void processSingleFile(File file) throws CheckstyleException {
    final String fileName = file.getAbsolutePath();
    try {
        if (shouldSkipFile(fileName, file.lastModified())) {
            return;
        }
        cacheFileIfNeeded(fileName, file.lastModified());
        auditFile(fileName, file);
    } catch (IOException | CheckstyleException ex) {
        handleProcessingException(fileName, ex);
    }
}

private boolean shouldSkipFile(String fileName, long timestamp) {
    return cacheFile != null && cacheFile.isInCache(fileName, timestamp)
            || !acceptFileStarted(fileName);
}

private void cacheFileIfNeeded(String fileName, long timestamp) {
    if (cacheFile != null) {
        cacheFile.put(fileName, timestamp);
    }
}

private void auditFile(String fileName, File file) throws CheckstyleException {
    fireFileStarted(fileName);
    final SortedSet<Violation> fileMessages = processFile(file);
    fireErrors(fileName, fileMessages);
    fireFileFinished(fileName);
}

private void handleProcessingException(String fileName, Exception ex) throws CheckstyleException {
    if (cacheFile != null) {
        cacheFile.remove(fileName);
    }
    throw new CheckstyleException("Exception occurred while processing " + fileName, ex);
}
```

In this refactoring, I've:
- Extracted logic into smaller methods (`processSingleFile`, `shouldSkipFile`, `cacheFileIfNeeded`, `auditFile`, and `handleProcessingException`) for better readability and maintainability.
- Improved exception handling by catching specific exceptions (`IOException` and `CheckstyleException`) instead of a generic `Exception` or `Error`.
- Removed deep nesting by using early returns.

This refactoring demonstrates the application of several of the suggested improvements. Similar principles can be applied to other parts of the code.
