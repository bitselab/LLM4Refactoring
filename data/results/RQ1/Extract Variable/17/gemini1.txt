This code demonstrates a well-organized and readable approach to managing explicit and effective modifiers for AST nodes. There are minimal refactoring opportunities due to the clear separation of concerns and well-defined logic within each method. However, there are a few minor suggestions:

1. **Consider Alternative for `EffectiveModifierVisitor`:**  
The `EffectiveModifierVisitor` class currently utilizes a single inheritance approach for `JavaVisitorBase`. An alternative approach could be to implement a dedicated interface like `EffectiveModifierCalculator` with a single method `calculateEffectiveModifiers` that takes the explicit modifiers and AST node as arguments. This can improve separation of concerns and potentially allow for future extension with different effective modifier calculation strategies.

2. **Simplify `JUST_FINAL` Usage:**  
The `JUST_FINAL` constant is a singleton `Set` containing only the `FINAL` modifier. Consider using `Collections.singleton(JModifier.FINAL)` directly where this constant is used.

Overall, the code is well-structured and functional. The suggested improvements are minor and focus on potential future maintainability and extensibility.
