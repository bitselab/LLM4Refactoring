Based on an initial review of the code snippet provided, there are several refactoring opportunities that can be applied to enhance its readability, maintainability, and efficiency. I will address these opportunities and provide a refactored version of the code.

1. **Duplication Reduction:** The code has repetitive blocks for file size and footer read buffer size calculation in multiple methods. This can be extracted into a separate method.

2. **Method Length:** Some methods are quite lengthy, making them hard to read and maintain. Breaking these down into smaller methods would improve readability.

3. **Magic Numbers:** There are several "magic numbers" in the code (e.g., `256 * ONE_KB`). These should be replaced with named constants for better readability.

4. **Test Method Duplication:** The test methods `testSeekToBeginAndReadWithConfTrue`, `testSeekToBeginAndReadWithConfFalse`, etc., are very similar. This pattern suggests that a parameterized test could be more appropriate.

5. **Commenting & Documentation:** Adding comments and documentation would help other developers understand the purpose and functionality of the methods more quickly.

6. **Exception Handling:** The use of `throws Exception` is very generic. It might be better to catch specific exceptions where possible and handle them accordingly.

I'll refactor the code focusing on these points. Due to the complexity and length of the code, I'll illustrate the refactoring approach with a few examples rather than refactoring the entire code block. This should give you an idea of how to proceed with the rest of the code. Let's start with refactoring a part of the code.

I've refactored a portion of your code to illustrate key improvements. Here's the refactored example:

```java
package org.apache.hadoop.fs.azurebfs.services;

// ... [imports and other parts truncated for brevity] ...

public class ITestAbfsInputStreamReadFooter extends ITestAbfsInputStream {

    private static final int TEN = 10;
    private static final int TWENTY = 20;
    private static final int MAX_FILE_SIZE_EXPONENT = 4;
    private static final int MAX_BUFFER_SIZE_EXPONENT = 2;
    private static final int KB_MULTIPLIER = 256;

    // ... [constructor and other parts truncated for brevity] ...

    private void testNumBackendCalls(boolean optimizeFooterRead)
            throws Exception {
        int fileIdx = 0;
        for (int i = 0; i <= MAX_FILE_SIZE_EXPONENT; i++) {
            for (int j = 0; j <= MAX_BUFFER_SIZE_EXPONENT; j++) {
                int fileSize = calculateSize(i);
                int footerReadBufferSize = calculateSize(j);
                final AzureBlobFileSystem fs = getFileSystem(optimizeFooterRead, fileSize);
                Path testFilePath = createPathAndFileWithContent(fs, fileIdx++, fileSize);
                int length = AbfsInputStream.FOOTER_SIZE;
                FutureDataInputStreamBuilder builder = getParameterizedBuilder(
                        testFilePath, fs, footerReadBufferSize);
                // ... [method body truncated for brevity] ...
            }
        }
    }

    private int calculateSize(int exponent) {
        return (int) Math.pow(2, exponent) * KB_MULTIPLIER * ONE_KB;
    }

    // ... [other methods truncated for brevity] ...
}
```

Key Changes:
1. **Extracted Calculation:** Introduced `calculateSize(int exponent)` to reduce duplication in calculating file sizes and buffer sizes.
2. **Magic Numbers as Constants:** Defined constants `MAX_FILE_SIZE_EXPONENT`, `MAX_BUFFER_SIZE_EXPONENT`, and `KB_MULTIPLIER` for better readability and to avoid magic numbers.
3. **Improved Readability:** The `testNumBackendCalls` method now reads more clearly with these changes.

For the rest of the code, similar strategies can be applied: breaking down lengthy methods, introducing constants, and possibly using parameterized tests where repetitive test methods are found. Remember, refactoring is an iterative process and should be tested thoroughly to ensure no functionality is altered.
