In this code snippet, we can apply the "Extract Variable" refactoring technique to improve readability and potentially enhance maintainability. This technique involves creating new variables for expressions that are repeated or are complex. Here are some opportunities for refactoring:

1. **Repeated Method Calls**: Calls to methods like `getHttpSender()` and `getHttpReceiver()` are repeated in methods like `proceed`, `abort`, and `abortResponse`. Extracting these to local variables can improve readability.

2. **Complex Expressions**: In methods like `associate`, `disassociate`, and `abort`, there are complex conditional expressions. Extracting these to variables can make the code easier to understand.

Let's apply these refactoring changes to the code.

### Refactored Code

```java
package org.eclipse.jetty.client;

import org.eclipse.jetty.client.api.Connection;
import org.eclipse.jetty.client.api.Result;
import org.eclipse.jetty.io.CyclicTimeouts;
import org.eclipse.jetty.util.thread.AutoLock;
import org.slf4j.Logger;
import org.slf4j.LoggerFactory;

public abstract class HttpChannel implements CyclicTimeouts.Expirable {
    private static final Logger LOG = LoggerFactory.getLogger(HttpChannel.class);

    private final AutoLock _lock = new AutoLock();
    private final HttpDestination _destination;
    private HttpExchange _exchange;

    protected HttpChannel(HttpDestination destination) {
        _destination = destination;
    }

    public void destroy() {
    }

    public HttpDestination getHttpDestination() {
        return _destination;
    }

    public boolean associate(HttpExchange exchange) {
        boolean result = false;
        try (AutoLock ignored = _lock.lock()) {
            if (_exchange == null) {
                result = exchange.associate(this);
                if (result) {
                    _exchange = exchange;
                }
            }
        }

        if (!result) {
            exchange.getRequest().abort(new UnsupportedOperationException("Pipelined requests not supported"));
        } else {
            exchange.getRequest().setConnection(getConnection());
            if (LOG.isDebugEnabled()) {
                LOG.debug("{} associated {} to {}", exchange, result, this);
            }
        }

        return result;
    }

    public boolean disassociate(HttpExchange exchange) {
        boolean result = false;
        try (AutoLock ignored = _lock.lock()) {
            if (_exchange == exchange) {
                _exchange.disassociate(this);
                _exchange = null;
                result = true;
            }
        }

        if (LOG.isDebugEnabled()) {
            LOG.debug("{} disassociated {} from {}", exchange, result, this);
        }
        return result;
    }

    public HttpExchange getHttpExchange() {
        try (AutoLock ignored = _lock.lock()) {
            return _exchange;
        }
    }

    protected abstract Connection getConnection();

    @Override
    public long getExpireNanoTime() {
        HttpExchange exchange = getHttpExchange();
        return exchange != null ? exchange.getExpireNanoTime() : Long.MAX_VALUE;
    }

    protected abstract HttpSender getHttpSender();

    protected abstract HttpReceiver getHttpReceiver();

    public void send() {
        HttpExchange exchange = getHttpExchange();
        if (exchange != null) {
            send(exchange);
        }
    }

    public abstract void send(HttpExchange exchange);

    public abstract void release();

    public void proceed(HttpExchange exchange, Throwable failure) {
        HttpSender sender = getHttpSender();
        sender.proceed(exchange, failure);
    }

    public boolean abort(HttpExchange exchange, Throwable requestFailure, Throwable responseFailure) {
        boolean requestAborted = requestFailure != null && getHttpSender().abort(exchange, requestFailure);
        boolean responseAborted = responseFailure != null && abortResponse(exchange, responseFailure);
        return requestAborted || responseAborted;
    }

    public boolean abortResponse(HttpExchange exchange, Throwable failure) {
        HttpReceiver receiver = getHttpReceiver();
        return receiver.abort(exchange, failure);
    }

    public Result exchangeTerminating(HttpExchange exchange, Result result) {
        return result;
    }

    public void exchangeTerminated(HttpExchange exchange, Result result) {
        disassociate(exchange);
    }

    @Override
    public String toString() {
        HttpExchange currentExchange = getHttpExchange();
        return String.format("%s@%x(exchange=%s)", getClass().getSimpleName(), hashCode(), currentExchange);
    }
}
```

#### Changes Made:
- Extracted `HttpSender sender = getHttpSender()` in `proceed` method.
- Extracted `HttpReceiver receiver = getHttpReceiver()` in `abortResponse` method.
- Simplified the `associate` method by removing the `abort` variable and directly using the `result` variable for conditional logic.
- Extracted `HttpExchange currentExchange = getHttpExchange()` in `toString` method.

These changes should enhance the readability of the code by reducing the complexity of expressions and minimizing repeated method calls.
