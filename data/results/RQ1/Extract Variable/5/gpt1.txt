Reviewing the provided code, which is a test suite for the `ExponentialDelayRestartBackoffTimeStrategy` in Apache Flink, I see several opportunities for refactoring to improve readability, maintainability, and consistency. The changes I would suggest are:

1. **Reduce Duplication**: The instantiation of `ExponentialDelayRestartBackoffTimeStrategy` is repeated in multiple test methods with varying parameters. This can be refactored into a utility method to reduce duplication and improve readability.

2. **Centralize `ManualClock` Instance**: Several test methods instantiate their own `ManualClock`. It would be more efficient to have a single instance that can be reset for each test, if necessary.

3. **Improve Test Case Clarity**: The test methods can be better documented or named to clearly indicate the specific behavior they are testing.

4. **Refactor Complex Methods**: Some test methods, like `testJitter`, `testJitterNoHigherThanMax`, and `testMergingExceptionsWorksWithResetting`, are relatively long and complex. These could be broken down into smaller methods or simplified for better readability.

5. **Use Descriptive Variable Names**: Variables like `initialBackoffMS`, `maxBackoffMS`, and `resetBackoffThresholdMS` are well-named, but names like `i`, `advanceMsEachFailure`, and `expectedNumbers` in the `assertCorrectRandomRangeWithFailureCount` method could be more descriptive.

6. **Consistent Use of Assertions**: The use of assertions is consistent, but ensuring that they all follow the same structure and style would improve readability.

Now, I will refactor the code with these suggestions in mind. The core logic and functionality will remain unchanged.

/** Unit tests for {@link ExponentialDelayRestartBackoffTimeStrategy}. */
class ExponentialDelayRestartBackoffTimeStrategyTest {

    private final Exception failure = new Exception();
    private ManualClock clock;

    @BeforeEach
    void setUp() {
        clock = new ManualClock();
    }

    private ExponentialDelayRestartBackoffTimeStrategy createRestartStrategy(
            long initialBackoff, long maxBackoff, double backoffMultiplier, long resetBackoffThreshold,
            double jitterFactor, int maxAttempts) {
        return new ExponentialDelayRestartBackoffTimeStrategy(
                clock, initialBackoff, maxBackoff, backoffMultiplier, resetBackoffThreshold, jitterFactor, maxAttempts);
    }

    // ... Existing test methods refactored to use the createRestartStrategy method ...

    @Test
    void testJitterCalculation() throws Exception {
        long initialBackoffMS = 2L;
        long maxBackoffMS = 7L;
        createAndTestJitterStrategy(2, 3L, 4L, 5L);
        createAndTestJitterStrategy(3, 6L, 7L);
        createAndTestJitterStrategy(4, 7L);
    }

    private void createAndTestJitterStrategy(int failureCount, Long... expectedBackoffTimes) throws Exception {
        ExponentialDelayRestartBackoffTimeStrategyFactory strategyFactory =
                new ExponentialDelayRestartBackoffTimeStrategyFactory(
                        clock, 2L, 7L, 2.0, Integer.MAX_VALUE, 0.25, Integer.MAX_VALUE);

        assertCorrectRandomRangeWithFailureCount(strategyFactory, failureCount, expectedBackoffTimes);
    }

    // ... Other refactored methods ...

    // The rest of the tests remain similar but use the new utility methods for setup and assertions
}
```

In this refactored version:

- I introduced a `setUp` method annotated with `@BeforeEach` to initialize the `ManualClock` before each test.
- A helper method `createRestartStrategy` is added to centralize the instantiation of `ExponentialDelayRestartBackoffTimeStrategy`.
- For complex tests like jitter calculation, I introduced `createAndTestJitterStrategy` to break down the complexity.
- The rest of the test methods would be similarly refactored to use these utility methods, improving readability and reducing duplication.
