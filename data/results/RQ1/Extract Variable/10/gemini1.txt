No major refactoring is necessary for this code snippet. The code is well-structured and adheres to good practices like using interfaces and optional types. Here's a breakdown of why the code is well-written:

* **Clear interface:** The `ResolvedTypeParameterValueProvider` interface clearly defines the expected behavior.
* **Optional usage:** The `typeParamValue` method returns `Optional<ResolvedType>`, indicating potential absence of a value.
* **Recursive handling:** The `useThisTypeParametersOnTheGivenType` method recursively applies itself to handle nested types.

Here are some minor improvements that could be considered:

* **Early return in useThisTypeParametersOnTheGivenType:** The infinite loop check can potentially be moved before the first `if` block to improve efficiency:

```java
if (type.isWildcard() && !type.equals(type.asWildcard().getBoundedType())) {
  // ... (rest of the logic for wildcards)
}
```

* **Javadoc improvements:** The Javadoc for `useThisTypeParametersOnTheGivenType` could be slightly improved to clarify the purpose of the infinite loop check.

Overall, the provided code demonstrates a good understanding of object-oriented design principles and type safety.
