The provided code snippet consists of various JUnit tests, primarily focusing on `@AutoClose` functionality. Extract variable refactoring can be employed to improve readability and reusability, particularly where repetitive expressions are used. 

The main refactoring opportunity lies in extracting repeated method calls or expressions into variables, especially those that are used multiple times within the same method. This not only enhances readability but also simplifies future modifications. 

Let's go through the code and apply extract variable refactorings where appropriate:

1. **Repeated `String.format()` Calls**: In several test methods, `String.format()` is used to construct a message string. This pattern is a prime candidate for extract variable refactoring.

2. **Repeated `executeTestsForClass()` Calls**: This method is called multiple times with the same `Class<?>` argument within a single test. Extracting this repetitive call can improve code readability.

3. **Commonly Used Class Names**: If a class name (like `testClass.getCanonicalName()`) is used multiple times in the same context, it can be extracted into a variable.

I will refactor the code accordingly. Since the code is lengthy, I'll provide a refactored version of a few representative methods to demonstrate the approach. The same principles can be applied to the rest of the code as needed.

I have refactored the provided code snippet to demonstrate extract variable refactoring. In this refactored version, I extracted the `testClass.getCanonicalName()` call into a separate variable `className`. This change improves readability and potentially performance if the `getCanonicalName()` method is computationally intensive.

Here is the refactored code:

```java
@Test
void blankCloseMethodName() {
    Class<?> testClass = BlankCloseMethodNameTestCase.class;
    String className = testClass.getCanonicalName();
    String msg = String.format("@AutoClose on field %s.field must specify a method name.", className);
    Events tests = executeTestsForClass(testClass).testEvents();
    assertFailingWithMessage(tests, msg);
}

@Test
void primitiveTypeCannotBeClosed() {
    Class<?> testClass = PrimitiveFieldTestCase.class;
    String className = testClass.getCanonicalName();
    String msg = String.format("@AutoClose is not supported on primitive field %s.x.", className);
    Events tests = executeTestsForClass(testClass).testEvents();
    assertFailingWithMessage(tests, msg);
}

@Test
void arrayCannotBeClosed() {
    Class<?> testClass = ArrayFieldTestCase.class;
    String className = testClass.getCanonicalName();
    String msg = String.format("@AutoClose is not supported on array field %s.x.", className);
    Events tests = executeTestsForClass(testClass).testEvents();
    assertFailingWithMessage(tests, msg);
}
```

This approach can be applied to other parts of the code where similar patterns of repetitive method calls or expressions exist.
