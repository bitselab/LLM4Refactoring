The provided code demonstrates a well-structured and organized approach to testing the `@AutoClose` functionality. Here's why there are minimal refactoring opportunities:

- **Clear Class Separation:** Tests are grouped into dedicated classes based on functionality (e.g., `BlankCloseMethodNameTestCase`).
- **Meaningful Variable Names:** Variable names like `recorder`, `closed`, and `nestedStaticClosable` clearly describe their purpose.
- **Descriptive Test Names:** Test names like `noCloseMethod` and `fieldsAreProperlyClosedWithNestedTestClassesWithInstancePerMethod` convey their intent effectively.
- **Reusable Helper Methods:** Methods like `assertFailingWithMessage` and `findExecution` are used throughout the test suite, promoting code reuse.
- **Mocking and Stubbing:** The `AutoCloseSpy` class effectively mocks the behavior of an auto-closable resource for testing purposes.

While there's no significant need for refactoring at this point, here are a couple of minor suggestions for improvement:

- **Consider Test Data Builder:** You could potentially introduce a test data builder for `AutoCloseSpy` to simplify object creation with various configurations (fail or not fail on close).
- **Centralize Common Assertions:** If specific assertions like `assertThat(closed).isFalse()` are used repeatedly, you could create a helper method to centralize them and improve readability.

Overall, the code prioritizes clarity, maintainability, and testability. There's no immediate need for refactoring, but the suggestions mentioned above could be considered for minor improvements.
