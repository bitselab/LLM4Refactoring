## Refactoring Opportunities

The code snippet contains several areas that could be refactored to improve readability and maintainability. Here are some suggestions:

1. **Reduce code duplication:** There is a significant amount of code duplication in the methods `testNumBackendCalls`, `testSeekAndReadWithConf`, `testPartialReadWithNoData`, and `testPartialReadWithSomeData`. These methods can be refactored into a single helper method that takes the necessary parameters and performs the common logic.

2. **Extract helper methods:**  There are several other methods that could be extracted into helper methods to improve code readability. For example, the methods `createPathAndFileWithContent`, `getParameterizedBuilder`, `getFileSystem`, and `verifyConfigValueInStream` could all be refactored into separate helper methods.

3. **Use descriptive variable names:** Some variable names are not very descriptive, such as `i`, `j`, and `length`. Using more descriptive names would improve code readability.

4. **Simplify logic:**  The logic in some methods, such as `seekPos` and `assertContentReadCorrectly`,  can be simplified.

Here's a refactored version of the code snippet incorporating these suggestions:

```java
public class ITestAbfsInputStreamReadFooter extends ITestAbfsInputStream {

    private static final int TEN = 10;
    private static final int TWENTY = 20;
    private static final int ONE_KB = 1024;

    public ITestAbfsInputStreamReadFooter() throws Exception {
    }

    @Test
    public void testOptimizeFooterRead() throws Exception {
        testNumBackendCalls(true);
    }

    @Test
    public void testNoOptimizeFooterRead() throws Exception {
        testNumBackendCalls(false);
    }

    private void testNumBackendCalls(boolean optimizeFooterRead) throws Exception {
        for (int fileIdx = 0; fileIdx <= 4; fileIdx++) {
            for (int fileSize = 256 * ONE_KB; fileSize <= 4 * ONE_KB; fileSize *= 2) {
                for (int footerReadBufferSize = 256 * ONE_KB; footerReadBufferSize <= 1 * ONE_KB; footerReadBufferSize *= 2) {
                    testBackendCalls(optimizeFooterRead, fileSize, footerReadBufferSize);
                }
            }
        }
    }

    private void testBackendCalls(boolean optimizeFooterRead, int fileSize, int footerReadBufferSize) throws Exception {
        final AzureBlobFileSystem fs = getFileSystem(optimizeFooterRead, fileSize);
        Path testFilePath = createPathAndFileWithContent(fs, fileIdx++, fileSize);

        try (FSDataInputStream iStream = getBuilder(fs, testFilePath, footerReadBufferSize).build().get()) {
            verifyConfigValueInStream(iStream, footerReadBufferSize);
            performSeekAndReadTests(fs, iStream, fileSize);
        }
    }

    private void performSeekAndReadTests(final AzureBlobFileSystem fs, FSDataInputStream iStream, final int fileSize) throws Exception {
        AbfsInputStream abfsInputStream = (AbfsInputStream) iStream.getWrappedStream();
        for (SeekTo seekTo : SeekTo.values()) {
            testSeekAndRead(fs, abfsInputStream, seekTo, fileSize);
        }
    }
