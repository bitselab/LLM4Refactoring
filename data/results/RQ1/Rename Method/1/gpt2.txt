Reviewing the code for potential rename method refactoring opportunities, the focus is on improving the clarity and expressiveness of method names. Here are my suggestions for renaming:

1. `createPattern`: This method name is clear but could be more specific. Consider renaming it to `compileRegexPattern` to emphasize that it compiles a regular expression into a pattern.

2. `matchesFileExtension`: This method checks if the file's extension matches any in a given set. A more descriptive name could be `doesFileExtensionMatch`.

3. `hasWhitespaceBefore`: This method name is descriptive, but for consistency and clarity, consider renaming it to `containsWhitespaceBeforeIndex`.

4. `lengthMinusTrailingWhitespace`: This method name is quite long and could be simplified to `lengthWithoutTrailingWhitespace`.

5. `lengthExpandedTabs`: The current name is a bit unclear. A more descriptive name could be `calculateLengthWithExpandedTabs`.

6. `isPatternValid`: This name is clear but could be more specific. Consider renaming it to `isValidRegexPattern`.

7. `baseClassName`: This method extracts the class name from a fully qualified name. A clearer name might be `extractSimpleClassName`.

8. `relativizeAndNormalizePath`: The name is descriptive but a bit lengthy. Consider renaming it to `createRelativeNormalizedPath`.

9. `getConstructor`: This is clear but a bit generic. A more specific name like `findConstructorOfClass` might be more descriptive.

10. `invokeConstructor`: Similar to the above, consider renaming it to `newInstanceFromConstructor`.

11. `close`: This is a generic name. Consider renaming it to `closeResourceSafely` or `closeWithExceptionHandling`.

12. `getUriByFilename`: This could be renamed to `resolveUriFromFilename` for clarity.

13. `getWebOrFileProtocolUri`: Consider renaming to `resolveUriForWebOrFileProtocol`.

14. `getFilepathOrClasspathUri`: Consider renaming to `resolveUriForFilePathOrClasspath`.

15. `getResourceFromClassPath`: This could be renamed to `findUriForResourceInClasspath`.

16. `getCheckstyleResource`: A more specific name like `findCheckstyleResourceUri` could be clearer.

17. `fillTemplateWithStringsByRegexp`: Consider renaming to `populateTemplateWithRegexMatches`.

18. `getFileNameWithoutExtension`: This is clear, but for consistency, consider renaming it to `extractFileNameWithoutExtension`.

19. `getFileExtension`: For consistency, this could be `extractFileExtension`.

20. `isIdentifier` and `isName`: These names are clear and concise. No change needed.

21. `isBlank`: Clear and concise. No change needed.

22. `indexOfNonWhitespace`: This name is clear, but for consistency, consider renaming it to `findFirstNonWhitespaceIndex`.

23. `isCodePointWhitespace`: Clear and concise. No change needed.

Renaming methods can enhance the readability and maintainability of the code. However, it's important to ensure that these changes are consistent throughout the codebase and that any documentation or comments are updated accordingly. Additionally, consider the impact of these changes on any existing users of this API, as method renaming can break backward compatibility.
