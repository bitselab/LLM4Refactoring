Reviewing the provided code snippet for potential rename method refactoring opportunities, I've identified a few methods where the names could be improved for better readability and clarity:

1. **`cleanupData`**: This method name is somewhat generic. A more descriptive name like `clearDataIfConfigured` would better convey the method's purpose, which includes a conditional check based on configuration.

2. **`tearDownSessionFactory`**: The name is clear but it could be more aligned with the rest of the code. A name like `closeSessionFactory` might be more consistent with the Java naming conventions for closing resources.

3. **`clearAllData`**: This method name is appropriate but could be more specific. Renaming it to `clearDatabaseAndIndexData` would provide more insight into what data is being cleared.

4. **`clearDatabase` (overloaded methods)**: The name is fine, but it might be better to have distinct names for each overload to reflect their different behaviors. The method without the `tenantId` parameter could be named `clearDatabaseForAllTenants`, and the one with the `tenantId` parameter could be `clearDatabaseForTenant`.

5. **`clearEntityInstances`**: This name is quite general. Renaming it to `deleteEntityInstances` might be more descriptive, emphasizing the deletion operation.

6. **`selectAllOfSpecificType` and `deleteAllOfSpecificType`**: These names are descriptive but could be simplified. `selectAllEntitiesOfType` and `deleteAllEntitiesOfType` would be clearer.

7. **`createSelectOrDeleteAllOfSpecificTypeQuery`**: This method's name is very long and somewhat confusing. A more concise name like `createQueryForEntityType` could be used with detailed documentation explaining its dual purpose.

8. **`hasEntitySubclass` and `hasPotentiallyJoinTable`**: These names are good, but for consistency with the rest of the naming convention, they could be renamed to `doesEntityHaveSubclass` and `doesEntityHavePotentialJoinTable`.

Here's how the refactored method signatures would look:

```java
void clearDataIfConfigured();
private void closeSessionFactory(SessionFactoryImplementor sessionFactory);
private void clearDatabaseAndIndexData(SessionFactoryImplementor sessionFactory);
private void clearDatabaseForAllTenants(SessionFactoryImplementor sessionFactory, HibernateOrmMapping mapping);
private void clearDatabaseForTenant(SessionFactoryImplementor sessionFactory, HibernateOrmMapping mapping, String tenantId);
private static void deleteEntityInstances(SessionFactoryImplementor sessionFactory, HibernateOrmMapping mapping, String tenantId, EntityType<?> entityType);
private static Query<?> selectAllEntitiesOfType(EntityType<?> entityType, Session session);
private static Query<?> deleteAllEntitiesOfType(EntityType<?> entityType, Session session);
private static Query<?> createQueryForEntityType(EntityType<?> entityType, Session session, QueryType queryType);
private static boolean doesEntityHaveSubclass(SessionFactory sessionFactory, EntityType<?> parentEntity);
private static boolean doesEntityHavePotentialJoinTable(Class<?> entityJavaType, SessionFactoryImplementor sessionFactory, ManagedType<?> managedType);
```

These renaming suggestions aim to improve the clarity of the method names while still accurately describing their functionality.
