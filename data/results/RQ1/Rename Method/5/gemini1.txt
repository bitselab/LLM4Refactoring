 **Here are some refactoring opportunities to enhance the code:**

**1. Organize Hint-Related Methods:**
   - Encapsulate hint-related methods into a separate utility class (e.g., `HintUtils`).
   - Improve code organization and cohesion.

**2. Refactor Repetitive Hint Retrieval:**
   - Create a generic helper method to retrieve hints based on conditions.
   - Reduce code duplication and improve readability.

**3. Streamline Hint String Conversion:**
   - Utilize Java streams for a more functional and concise approach to building hint strings.
   - Enhance code clarity and maintainability.

**4. Improve `getTableAlias` Recursive Logic:**
   - Refactor the recursive logic to use a loop for better readability and potentially better performance.

**5. Separate Functionalities:**
   - Consider dividing the class into smaller focused classes based on functionality (e.g., hint processing, table name retrieval).
   - Promote code modularity and testability.

**Refactored Code (Example):**

```java
// New class for hint-related utilities
public class HintUtils {
    // ... hint-related methods from FlinkHints
}

// Refactored FlinkHints class
public abstract class FlinkHints {
    // ... other methods

    public static Optional<String> getTableAlias(RelNode node) {
        while (node != null) {
            if (node instanceof Hintable) {
                // ... hint retrieval logic ...
            } else if (canTransposeToTableScan(node)) {
                node = node.getInput(0);
            } else {
                break;
            }
        }
        return Optional.empty();
    }
}
```
