After reviewing the provided code snippet, there are several opportunities for renaming methods to enhance readability and clarity. The current method names are mostly clear, but some can be improved for better understanding of their functionality. Here are my suggestions:

1. **`getHintedOptions`**: Rename to `extractOptionsFromHints` to better reflect the action of extracting options from a given list of hints.

2. **`mergeTableOptions`**: This name is quite clear, but to be more explicit, consider renaming to `mergeDynamicAndStaticTableOptions`.

3. **`getTableAlias`**: This name is clear. No change needed.

4. **`canTransposeToTableScan`**: This name is somewhat unclear. Renaming to

`isTransposableToTableScan` would better convey the method's purpose of checking if a node can be transposed to a table scan.

5. **`getTableName`**: This method does more than just getting the table name; it also handles an exception case. A more descriptive name might be `extractQualifiedTableName`.

6. **`stringifyHints`**: This method converts hints to a string format. A more intuitive name could be `formatHintsAsString`.

7. **`getAllQueryHints`, `getAllJoinHints`, `getAllStateTtlHints`**: These methods are appropriately named as they accurately describe their functionality. No change needed.

8. **`getQueryBlockAliasHints`**: This name is clear, but for consistency with other renaming, consider `extractQueryBlockAliasHints`.

9. **`capitalizeJoinHints`**: This name is clear, but it might be more descriptive to rename it to `capitalizeHintsInJoinNodes` to reflect that it operates on join nodes.

10. **`resolveSubQuery`**: The current name is clear. No change needed.

11. **`clearQueryHintsOnUnmatchedNodes`**: This method name is clear and descriptive. No change needed.

12. **`isQueryHint`, `isKVQueryHint`**: These methods are well-named as they check the type of hints. No change needed.

These suggested renames are based on the provided code snippet and my understanding of its functionality. Renaming methods should always consider the broader context of the entire codebase, and it's important to ensure that any changes made are consistent with the naming conventions and design principles followed in your project.
