Analyzing the code for potential method renaming opportunities to improve readability, a few methods in the `ClasspathClassLoaderTest` class can be renamed for better clarity. The current method names, while descriptive, could be more specific to convey the exact purpose of each test and the private utility method. Here are the suggested changes:

1. `loadEmptyClasspathWithParent()` - Rename to `testLoadingWithEmptyClasspathAndParentClassLoader`. This name more clearly describes that the test is verifying the behavior of loading with an empty classpath when a parent class loader is provided.

2. `loadEmptyClasspathNoParent()` - Rename to `testLoadingWithEmptyClasspathAndNoParentClassLoader`. This name explains that the test is for loading with an empty classpath and without specifying a parent class loader.

3. `loadFromJar()` - Rename to `testLoadingResourceFromJarFile`. This name is more descriptive of the test's purpose, which is to verify loading a resource from a JAR file.

4. `loadFromJava17()` - Although the method name mentions Java 17, it's actually parameterized for multiple Java versions. Rename to `testLoadingFromClasspathWithDifferentJavaVersions` to reflect its broader scope.

5. `assertClassFile()` - Rename to `assertValidClassFileStructure`. This name more accurately describes the method's purpose of asserting the structure of a class file.

Here's the refactored code with the renamed methods:

```java
package net.sourceforge.pmd.internal.util;

// ... [other imports]

class ClasspathClassLoaderTest {
    @TempDir
    private Path tempDir;

    @Test
    void testLoadingWithEmptyClasspathAndParentClassLoader() throws IOException {
        // ... [method body remains unchanged]
    }

    @Test
    void testLoadingWithEmptyClasspathAndNoParentClassLoader() throws IOException {
        // ... [method body remains unchanged]
    }

    @Test
    void testLoadingResourceFromJarFile() throws IOException {
        // ... [method body remains unchanged]
    }

    @ParameterizedTest
    @ValueSource(ints = {11, 17, 21})
    void testLoadingFromClasspathWithDifferentJavaVersions(int javaVersion) throws IOException {
        // ... [method body remains unchanged]
    }

    private void assertValidClassFileStructure(DataInputStream data, int javaVersion) throws IOException {
        // ... [method body remains unchanged]
    }

    // ... [rest of the class remains unchanged]
}
```

These renamings make the purpose of each test and utility method clearer, enhancing the overall readability of the code.
