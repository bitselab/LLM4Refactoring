Absolutely, based on the provided code snippet, there are a few opportunities for rename method refactoring:

1. Refactor `getFieldName` method in `SimpleClass` class:

  - The current method name `getFieldName` is not very descriptive and doesn't clearly indicate its purpose. A better name would be something like `getFieldNameForDiff` as it reveals the context in which the field name is used (i.e., for generating diffs).

  Refactored code:

  ```java
  private static final String getFieldNameForDiff() {
      return "booleanField";
  }
  ```

2. Refactor `testListIsNonModifiable` method name:

  - The current method name `testListIsNonModifiable` is a bit verbose. A shorter and more concise name would be `testDiffsListIsImmutable` which clearly states the purpose of the test.

  Refactored code:

  ```java
  @Test
  public void testDiffsListIsImmutable() {
      // ... (rest of the code remains the same)
  }
  ```

These are the two main refactoring opportunities identified in the code. By applying these changes, the code becomes more readable and easier to understand.
