## Refactoring Opportunities in LexicalPreservingPrinter.java

The code you provided utilizes the Lexical Preserving Printer class to maintain the original formatting while modifying an AST (Abstract Syntax Tree). Here are some potential refactoring opportunities:

**1. Static vs Instance Methods:**

* Several methods like `storeInitialText`, `findNodeForToken`, and `storeInitialTextForOneNode` are currently static. While they operate on a specific `Node`, they don't rely on the state of the `LexicalPreservingPrinter` object itself. These can be converted to instance methods to improve readability and potentially reduce memory usage (by avoiding unnecessary object creation).

**2. Utility Class for TextElement Iterators:**

* The class currently defines a private `TextElementIteratorsFactory` with nested classes for iterators. This functionality could be extracted into a separate utility class for better organization and potential reuse in other parts of the project.

**3. Handling Variable Declarators:**

* The `tokensPreceding` method has special logic for handling `VariableDeclarator` nodes due to "fake types." This specific handling could be encapsulated in a separate method or class to improve code maintainability.

**4. Visitor Pattern for Pretty Printing:**

* Currently, `prettyPrintingTextNode` directly modifies the `NodeText` based on the node type. Consider using the Visitor Pattern to achieve the same functionality with potentially cleaner separation of concerns. A separate visitor class could implement the `accept` method for different node types and handle the text element creation logic.

**5. Leverage Existing Java Classes:**

* The code defines custom token types like `BOOLEAN`, `CHAR`, etc. Instead, consider using existing `JavaToken.Kind` enums for these primitive types for better type safety and potential integration with the Java parser library.

**6. Use Optional Effectively:**

* The `findNodeForToken` method uses `Optional.empty()` for cases where a node isn't found. Consider using `Optional.ofNullable` instead, as it avoids the need for an extra null check.

**7. Code Comments:**

* While the code includes some comments, adding more comments to explain complex sections like handling comments and child nodes could further improve readability.

These are some suggestions to improve the code structure and readability of the LexicalPreservingPrinter class. Remember to consider the trade-offs between complexity and maintainability when applying these refactoring techniques.
