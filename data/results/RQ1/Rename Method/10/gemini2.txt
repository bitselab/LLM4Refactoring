Certainly, here are some rename method refactoring opportunities in the provided code snippet:
 
 1. `storeInitialTextForOneNode` can be renamed to `setInitialStateForNodeText` as it better reflects the purpose of the method which is to set the initial state for the NodeText.
2. `prettyPrintingTextNode` can be renamed to `interpretNodeForPrinting` as it more accurately describes the method's functionality of interpreting a node for the purpose of printing.
3. `findIndentation` can be renamed to `getIndentation` as it suggests a getter method that retrieves the indentation for a node.

These are just a few suggestions, and the best rename option may vary depending on the specific coding conventions and preferences of your team.
