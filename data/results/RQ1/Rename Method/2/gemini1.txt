 **Here's a review of the code snippet, identifying potential refactoring opportunities:**

**1. Simplifying Constructor Chaining:**
- The constructors could be refactored to reduce redundancy and create a more streamlined code flow.
- The default constructor could directly call the most comprehensive constructor with default values for size, markSupported, and throwEofException.

**2. Optimizing EOF Handling:**
- The `checkThrowEof` method is called frequently within different methods. It could be refactored to be called only once within the `doEndOfFile` method, reducing code duplication.

**3. Encapsulating Mark/Reset State:**
- The `markSupported`, `mark`, `readLimit`, and `eof` variables are closely related to the mark/reset functionality. They could be encapsulated within a helper class or private inner class to improve code organization and maintainability.

**4. Handling Unsupported Operations:**
- The `throw UnsupportedOperationException` lines within `mark` and `reset` could be consolidated into a single helper method or using a checked exception for better exception handling.

**Here's the refactored code incorporating these suggestions:**

```java
package org.apache.commons.io.input;

// ... imports

public class NullInputStream extends InputStream {

    public static final NullInputStream INSTANCE = new NullInputStream();

    private final long size;
    private long position;
    private final boolean markSupported;
    private final boolean throwEofException;

    private MarkResetHelper markResetHelper = new MarkResetHelper();

    public NullInputStream() {
        this(0, true, false);
    }

    public NullInputStream(long size) {
        this(size, true, false);
    }

    public NullInputStream(long size, boolean markSupported, boolean throwEofException) {
        this.size = size;
        this.markSupported = markSupported;
        this.throwEofException = throwEofException;
    }

    // ... other methods (available, close, getPosition, getSize)

    @Override
    public synchronized void mark(int readLimit) {
        markResetHelper.mark(readLimit);
    }

    @Override
    public boolean markSupported() {
        return markSupported;
    }

    @Override
    public synchronized void reset() throws IOException {
        markResetHelper.reset();
    }

    // ... other methods (processByte, processBytes, read, skip)

    private int doEndOfFile() throws EOFException {
        if (throwEofException) {
            throw new EOFException("End of file reached");
        }
        return EOF;
    }

    private class MarkResetHelper {
        private long mark = -1;
        private long readLimit;

        void mark(int readLimit) {
            if (!markSupported) {
                throw new UnsupportedOperationException("Mark not supported");
            }
            this.mark = position;
            this.readLimit = readLimit;
        }

        void reset() throws IOException {
            if (!markSupported) {
                throw new UnsupportedOperationException("Reset not supported");
            }
            if (mark < 0) {
                throw new IOException("No position has been marked");
            }
            if (position > mark + readLimit) {
                throw new IOException("Marked position no longer valid");
            }
            position = mark;
        }
    }
}
```
