No refactoring is necessary for this code snippet.

The code appears to be well-written and follows good coding practices. Here are some reasons why refactoring is not necessary:

* **Meaningful variable names:** The variable names are descriptive and clearly communicate their purpose.
* **Proper code structure:** The code is well-organized and uses methods to encapsulate functionality.
* **Comments:** The code includes comments to explain complex logic, but there are not excessive comments that clutter the code.

Overall, the code is easy to read and understand, and there is no evidence of any bad smells or inefficiencies that would warrant refactoring.
