In this code, there are no major refactoring opportunities. The code is well-structured and uses clear method names. Here are some minor suggestions:

1. **Consider alternative for `ConcurrentReferenceHashMap`:** While `ConcurrentReferenceHashMap` is a good choice for a cache with weak references, depending on the use case, a simpler `HashMap` might suffice. This would reduce complexity slightly.

2. **Simplify `canThrowTypeNotPresentException` logic:** The logic in the `canThrowTypeNotPresentException` method can be slightly simplified by using an initializer block to populate the array based on the method return type.

Here's an example of the simplification for `canThrowTypeNotPresentException`:

```java
private final boolean[] canThrowTypeNotPresentException;

private AttributeMethods(Class<? extends Annotation> annotationType, Method[] attributeMethods) {
  this.annotationType = annotationType;
  this.attributeMethods = attributeMethods;
  this.canThrowTypeNotPresentException = new boolean[attributeMethods.length];
  for (int i = 0; i < attributeMethods.length; i++) {
    Method method = attributeMethods[i];
    Class<?> returnType = method.getReturnType();
    this.canThrowTypeNotPresentException[i] = (returnType == Class.class || returnType == Class[].class || returnType.isEnum());
    ReflectionUtils.makeAccessible(method);
  }
  // ... rest of the constructor
}
```

These are minor suggestions, and the final decision depends on the team's preferences and performance considerations. Overall, the code appears well-written and easy to understand.
