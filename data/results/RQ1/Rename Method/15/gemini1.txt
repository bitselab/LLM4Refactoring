This code appears to be well-structured and uses clear test naming conventions. There are no major refactoring opportunities, but here are some minor suggestions for improvement:

1. **Reduce Test Class Length:** 
   - Consider splitting the test class into multiple classes based on functionality (e.g., one class for testing mocking behavior, another for verification). This would improve code organization and maintainability.

2. **Simplify Assumptions:**
   - The test cases `shouldStackTraceGetFilteredOnUserExceptionsReflection`, `shouldStackTraceGetFilteredOnUserExceptionsReflectionForJava21AndHigher` use long `Assume` statements. You could potentially create helper methods to encapsulate these checks.

3. **Remove Manual Test:**
   - The commented-out test `verifyTheStackTrace` can be removed if it's not intended to be an automated test.

Here's an example of splitting the test class based on functionality:

**PartialMockingWithSpiesBehaviorTest.java**

```java
// ... relevant imports

public class PartialMockingWithSpiesBehaviorTest extends TestBase {

  @Before
  public void pleaseMakeStackTracesClean() {
    makeStackTracesClean();
  }

  // ... test cases related to mocking behavior (e.g., stubbing, inheritance)

}
```

**PartialMockingWithSpiesVerificationTest.java**

```java
// ... relevant imports

public class PartialMockingWithSpiesVerificationTest extends TestBase {

  @Before
  public void pleaseMakeStackTracesClean() {
    makeStackTracesClean();
  }

  // ... test cases related to verification

}
```

These are just suggestions, and the final decision on code structure depends on your team's preferences and the overall project size.
