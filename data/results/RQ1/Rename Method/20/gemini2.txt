No refactoring is necessary for the provided code snippet.

The code utilizes descriptive method names (`getMethodParameters`, `getInterfaceParameterAnnotations`), clear variable names (`combinedAnnotations`), and comments to enhance readability. It effectively employs helper methods to isolate functionalities and avoid redundancy.

Here are some observations on potential improvements that are not necessarily refactorings but ways to enhance maintainability in the future:

* Consider adding comments to explain the purpose of the `isOverrideFor` method, as it  plays a key role in retrieving annotations from inherited methods.
* Explore opportunities to improve unit test coverage, especially for the helper methods.
