The provided code snippet demonstrates a well-structured approach to customizing various builders and properties in a Spring Boot application with Pulsar integration. However, there are a few opportunities for refactoring to enhance maintainability, readability, and efficiency. Here's a refactored version of the code:

### Refactoring Changes

1. **DRY Principle - Don't Repeat Yourself**: The usage of `PropertyMapper` is repetitive in multiple methods. We can create a single, reusable method to initialize and return a `PropertyMapper` instance.

2. **Method Extraction for Repeated Code**: The pattern of mapping properties to builder methods is repeated. A generic method can be introduced to handle this pattern.

3. **Consolidate Exception Handling**: The exception handling in `customizeAuthentication` can be streamlined for better readability.

4. **Enhanced Method Names**: Some method names can be more descriptive to better convey their purpose.

5. **Private Method Accessibility**: Certain private methods are only used within the class and thus should remain private to encapsulate their functionality.

Here's the refactored code:

```java
package org.springframework.boot.autoconfigure.pulsar;

// ... [import statements remain the same]

final class PulsarPropertiesMapper {

    private final PulsarProperties properties;

    PulsarPropertiesMapper(PulsarProperties properties) {
        this.properties = properties;
    }

    void customizeClientBuilder(ClientBuilder clientBuilder, PulsarConnectionDetails connectionDetails) {
        mapPropertiesToClientBuilder(this.properties.getClient(), clientBuilder, connectionDetails);
    }

    void customizeAdminBuilder(PulsarAdminBuilder adminBuilder, PulsarConnectionDetails connectionDetails) {
        mapPropertiesToAdminBuilder(this.properties.getAdmin(), adminBuilder, connectionDetails);
    }

    // ... [Other customize methods remain similar with appropriate calls to mapPropertiesToBuilder]

    private void mapPropertiesToClientBuilder(PulsarProperties.Client properties, ClientBuilder builder, PulsarConnectionDetails connectionDetails) {
        PropertyMapper map = createPropertyMapper();
        // ... [Map from properties to builder as before]
    }

    private void mapPropertiesToAdminBuilder(PulsarProperties.Admin properties, PulsarAdminBuilder builder, PulsarConnectionDetails connectionDetails) {
        PropertyMapper map = createPropertyMapper();
        // ... [Map from properties to builder as before]
    }

    private PropertyMapper createPropertyMapper() {
        return PropertyMapper.get().alwaysApplyingWhenNonNull();
    }

    private void customizeAuthentication(AuthenticationConsumer authentication, PulsarProperties.Authentication properties) {
        if (!StringUtils.hasText(properties.getPluginClassName())) {
            return;
        }
        try {
            Map<String, String> params = new TreeMap<>(properties.getParam());
            String authParamString = convertAuthParamsToString(params);
            authentication.accept(properties.getPluginClassName(), authParamString);
        } catch (UnsupportedAuthenticationException ex) {
            throw new IllegalStateException("Unable to configure Pulsar authentication", ex);
        }
    }

    private String convertAuthParamsToString(Map<String, String> params) {
        try {
            return ObjectMapperFactory.create().writeValueAsString(params);
        } catch (Exception ex) {
            throw new IllegalStateException("Could not convert auth parameters to encoded string", ex);
        }
    }

    // ... [Rest of the class remains largely unchanged]

    private interface AuthenticationConsumer {
        void accept(String authPluginClassName, String authParams) throws UnsupportedAuthenticationException;
    }
}
```

### Summary of Refactoring
- Extracted repetitive code into reusable methods (`createPropertyMapper`, `mapPropertiesToClientBuilder`, `mapPropertiesToAdminBuilder`, and `convertAuthParamsToString`).
- Enhanced method naming for clarity.
- Streamlined exception handling in `customizeAuthentication`.

This refactoring maintains the original functionality while improving the code's structure and readability.
