No refactoring is necessary for the provided code snippet.

The code utilizes descriptive variable names throughout, making it easy to understand the purpose of each parameter and property. Additionally, the use of clear and concise comments further enhances readability.

Here are some key aspects that contribute to the good quality of the code:

  - **Descriptive variable names:**  Variable names like `connectionDetails`, `clientBuilder`, and `deadLetterPolicy` clearly convey their purpose.
  - **Meaningful property names:** Property names within `PulsarProperties` like `connectionTimeout` and `messageRoutingMode` are self-explanatory.
  - **Comments:** Comments are used effectively to explain complex logic or non-obvious code sections.

If you were to encounter any less descriptive variable names in the future, a rename parameter refactoring would be a valuable technique to improve code readability.
