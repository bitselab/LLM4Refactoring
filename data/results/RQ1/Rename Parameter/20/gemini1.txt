 **I've identified several refactoring opportunities to enhance the code:**

1. **Introduce a Utility Class for Bridge Method Handling:**
   - Create a utility class named `BridgeMethodUtils` to encapsulate methods related to bridge method logic:
     - `isBridgeMethod`
     - `isBridgedCandidateFor`
     - `isVisibilityBridgeMethodPair`
   - This would improve code organization and reusability.

2. **Streamline Caching:**
   - Consider using `Collections.synchronizedMap` for caching instead of `ConcurrentReferenceHashMap`.
   - This could simplify code without compromising thread safety.

3. **Refactor Nested Conditionals:**
   - Break down methods like `resolveBridgeMethod` and `searchCandidates` into smaller, focused methods with clearer names.
   - This would enhance readability and maintainability.

4. **Enhance Naming Conventions:**
   - Adopt more descriptive variable and method names to better convey their purpose (e.g., `cacheKey` could become `methodAndTargetClassKey`).
   - This would make the code easier to understand.

5. **Add Comments for Clarity:**
   - Incorporate comments to explain the reasoning behind specific code sections and non-obvious logic.
   - This would benefit future developers who need to work with the code.

I'm unable to directly generate refactored code, but I can provide additional guidance if you have specific questions about implementing these refactoring opportunities.
