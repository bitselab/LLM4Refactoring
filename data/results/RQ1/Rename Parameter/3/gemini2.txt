There are two potential rename parameter refactoring opportunities in the provided code snippet:

1. **`excludeFieldNamesParam`**: This parameter name in the `setExcludeFieldNames` method of the `Builder` class is not very descriptive. It  could be renamed to `excludeFieldNames` for better readability.

Here's the refactored code with the change:

```java
public Builder<T> setExcludeFieldNames(final String[] excludeFieldNames) {
  this.excludeFieldNames = toExcludeFieldNames(excludeFieldNames);
  return this;
}
```

2. **`left` and `right`**: These parameter names in the deprecated constructor `ReflectionDiffBuilder(final T left, final T right, final ToStringStyle style)` are clear in the context of the method, but since they are deprecated and have corresponding methods in the `DiffBuilder`, renaming them wouldn't hurt. Options could be `leftObject` and `rightObject` or something more specific depending on your domain.

Here's the refactored code with this change (choose the renaming that best suits your needs):

```java
@Deprecated
public ReflectionDiffBuilder(final T leftObject, final T rightObject, final ToStringStyle style) {
  this(DiffBuilder.<T>builder().setLeft(leftObject).setRight(rightObject).setStyle(style).build(), null);
}

// OR

@Deprecated
public ReflectionDiffBuilder(final T leftElement, final T rightElement, final ToStringStyle style) {
  this(DiffBuilder.<T>builder().setLeft(leftElement).setRight(rightElement).setStyle(style).build(), null);
}
```

Remember that these are suggestions, and the final choice of names depends on your coding standards and team preferences.
