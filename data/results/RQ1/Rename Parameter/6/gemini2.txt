**Refactoring Opportunities Identified:**

The provided code snippet presents several opportunities for renaming parameters to improve readability and maintain consistency. Here are specific examples:

1. **ContainerLaunchContext (clc):**

   - This abbreviation is not immediately clear to someone unfamiliar with the codebase. A more descriptive name would be `containerContext` or `containerLaunchConfiguration`.

2. **Credentials (ts):**

   - This abbreviation is even less intuitive. Consider using `containerCredentials` or `securityCredentials` to better convey the parameter's purpose.

3. **DataOutputBuffer (dob):**

   - While `DataOutputBuffer` might be technically accurate, it's less readable within this context. Rename it to `credentialStream` or `tokenStream` to reflect its usage.

4. **Exit Statuses (exitCode):**

   - Although plural, `exitCode` seems more fitting for a single value representing the exit status. If this parameter holds a list of potential exit codes, rename it to `expectedExitCodes`.  

**Refactored Code:**

```java
public class TestNMClient {
  // ... existing code ...

  private void testContainer(NMClientImpl client, int i, Container container,
                             ContainerLaunchContext containerContext, List<Integer> expectedExitCodes)
          throws YarnException, IOException {
    // ... existing code ...
    Credentials containerCredentials = new Credentials();
    DataOutputBuffer credentialStream = new DataOutputBuffer();
    containerCredentials.writeTokenStorageToStream(credentialStream);
    ByteBuffer securityTokens = ByteBuffer.wrap(credentialStream.getData(), 0, credentialStream.getLength());
    containerContext.setTokens(securityTokens);
    client.startContainer(container, containerContext);
    // ... existing code ...
  }

  // ... existing code ...
}
```

**Additional Notes:**

- The refactoring primarily focuses on improving readability through more descriptive parameter names.
- Consider applying consistent naming conventions throughout the codebase for better maintainability.
