## Refactoring Opportunities

There are a few rename parameter refactoring opportunities in the provided code snippet:

1. **`jdbcMutations`**: This parameter name describes the content of the list well, but it's a bit long. We could rename it to `mutations` for brevity.

2. **`generatedValuesDelegate`**: This parameter name is clear but not very concise. We can consider renaming it to `delegate` if its purpose within the function is clear from the context. However, if its role is specific to generated values, then a rename to `generatedValuesMutationHandler` might be more descriptive.

Here's the refactored code with the suggested changes:

```java
public class PreparedStatementGroupStandard implements PreparedStatementGroup {

  private final MutationType mutationType;
  private final MutationTarget<?> mutationTarget;
  private final List<PreparableMutationOperation> mutations; // renamed from jdbcMutations
  private final SharedSessionContractImplementor session;

  private final SortedMap<String, PreparedStatementDetails> statementMap;

  public PreparedStatementGroupStandard(
      MutationType mutationType,
      MutationTarget<?> mutationTarget,
      GeneratedValuesMutationDelegate delegate, // renamed from generatedValuesDelegate
      List<PreparableMutationOperation> mutations,
      SharedSessionContractImplementor session) {
    this.mutationType = mutationType;
    this.mutationTarget = mutationTarget;
    this.mutations = mutations;

    this.session = session;

    this.statementMap = createStatementDetailsMap(mutations, mutationType, delegate, session);
  }

  // ... rest of the code remains the same ...
}
```

Remember, these are just suggestions. The final decision on renaming should consider clarity, consistency with the surrounding codebase, and team preferences.
