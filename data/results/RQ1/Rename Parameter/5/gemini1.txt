 **I've identified several refactoring opportunities in the code:**

1. **Combine `visitChild` and `visitBiRel`:**
   - The `visitChild` method is primarily responsible for updating the `currentInheritPath` and then calling `super.visitChild`.
   - The `visitBiRel` method performs logic specific to `BiRel` nodes and also calls `super.visitChild`.
   - These methods can be combined to reduce code duplication and simplify the logic flow:

   ```java
   @Override
   protected RelNode visitChild(RelNode parent, int i, RelNode child) {
       currentInheritPath.addLast(i);
       RelNode newNode = visit(child); // Call visit recursively for nested processing
       currentInheritPath.removeLast();
       return newNode;
   }

   @Override
   public RelNode visit(BiRel biRel) {
       // ... existing logic for BiRel nodes
   }
   ```

2. **Simplify `isMatchInvalidInheritPath`:**
   - The current implementation involves creating a copy of `currentInheritPath`, which might be less efficient.
   - It can be simplified using `Iterables.elementsEqual` from Guava (assuming Guava is available):

   ```java
   private boolean isMatchInvalidInheritPath(Iterable<Integer> invalidInheritPath, List<Integer> checkedInheritPath) {
       return Iterables.elementsEqual(invalidInheritPath, checkedInheritPath);
   }
   ```

3. **Consider Extracting Hint Removal Logic:**
   - The logic for finding and removing invalid query hints is scattered across multiple methods.
   - It could be encapsulated in a separate method for better readability and potential reusability:

   ```java
   private RelNode removeInvalidQueryHint(Hintable hintable) {
       List<RelHint> hints = new ArrayList<>(hintable.getHints());
       hints.removeIf(this::isInvalidQueryHint);
       return super.visit(hintable.withHints(hints));
   }
   ```

4. **Consider Alternative Hint Handling Approach:**
   - The current approach involves iteratively removing hints using shuttles.
   - It might be worth exploring a more declarative approach (e.g., using a HintStrategy), potentially simplifying the logic and improving maintainability.

**Remember that refactoring is context-dependent. It's best to evaluate these suggestions within your project's specific requirements and constraints.**
