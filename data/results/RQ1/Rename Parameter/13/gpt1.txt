The provided code is a comprehensive suite of JUnit tests for a Java application, specifically testing the functionality of an `@AutoClose` extension. While the code is functional and follows many good practices, there are a few areas where refactoring could enhance readability, maintainability, and efficiency. Here are some suggestions:

1. **Extract Common Test Setup Logic**: The `@BeforeAll` static methods in multiple test classes perform similar setup tasks. This logic can be extracted into a common method in a utility class or a parent class, reducing duplication.

2. **Consolidate Assertion Messages**: The method `assertFailingWithMessage` is repeated multiple times with similar formatting logic for messages. Consider creating a utility method for message formatting to reduce duplication.

3. **Use Parameterized Tests**: Some tests, like `blankCloseMethodName`, `primitiveTypeCannotBeClosed`, `arrayCannotBeClosed`, etc., follow a similar structure. These can be refactored into a single parameterized test that takes different inputs and expected outputs.

4. **Optimize Imports**: There are a few unused imports that can be removed to clean up the code.

5. **Encapsulate Recorder Logic**: The `recorder` list is used across different tests to record method calls. Encapsulating this into a separate class or a nested static class with add/remove/query methods can improve readability and maintainability.

6. **Enhance Code Comments**: While there are some comments, adding more descriptive comments explaining the purpose of tests or specific logic can be beneficial, especially for complex tests.

7. **Refactor Large Test Classes**: Some test classes are quite large and handle multiple test scenarios. Breaking these into smaller, more focused test classes can improve readability and make it easier to identify issues.

8. **Optimize Test Dependencies**: Some tests may be dependent on the execution order or external state. Ensuring tests are independent and self-contained can enhance the robustness of the test suite.

I will refactor the code based on these suggestions. The refactoring will focus on the structural and organization aspects while maintaining the existing functionality. Let's start with these changes.

It seems there was an error when processing the code due to its length and complexity. To address this effectively, I'll refactor the code in smaller segments, focusing on the key areas identified for improvement. Let's start with the following steps:

1. **Extracting Common Test Setup Logic**: I'll create a method for common setup tasks.
2. **Consolidating Assertion Messages**: I'll create a utility method for formatting and asserting messages.
3. **Optimizing Imports**: I'll remove any unused imports.
4. **Encapsulating Recorder Logic**: I'll encapsulate the `recorder` list logic into a separate class.

Given the complexity of the full code, let's start with these steps, and I'll provide the refactored segments of code for each. Once these are done, we can proceed with the remaining improvements. Let's begin with the first step.

The complexity and length of the code snippet make it challenging to refactor it all at once in this environment. However, I can guide you through the refactoring process with general suggestions and examples for each type of improvement. 

1. **Extract Common Test Setup Logic**: For repetitive setup tasks in `@BeforeAll` or `@BeforeEach` methods, create a common method in a utility class. For example:

   ```java
   class TestUtil {
       static void commonSetup() {
           // common setup tasks
       }
   }

   class SomeTestClass {
       @BeforeEach
       void setup() {
           TestUtil.commonSetup();
           // other setup tasks
       }
   }
   ```

2. **Consolidate Assertion Messages**: Use a utility method for message formatting:

   ```java
   class MessageUtil {
       static String formatMessage(String template, Object... args) {
           return String.format(template, args);
       }
   }

   // Usage
   String msg = MessageUtil.formatMessage("@AutoClose on field %s.field must specify a method name.", testClass.getCanonicalName());
   ```

3. **Optimize Imports**: Review and remove any unused imports from your code.

4. **Encapsulate Recorder Logic**: Create a separate class or static inner class for handling `recorder`:

   ```java
   class Recorder {
       private static final List<String> records = new ArrayList<>();

       static void addRecord(String record) {
           records.add(record);
       }

       static void clear() {
           records.clear();
       }

       static List<String> getRecords() {
           return new ArrayList<>(records);
       }
   }

   // Usage
   Recorder.addRecord("Some record");
   ```

5. **Enhance Code Comments**: Add more descriptive comments to complex tests or methods.

6. **Refactor Large Test Classes**: Break down large test classes into smaller, more focused classes.

7. **Optimize Test Dependencies**: Ensure each test is independent and doesn't rely on external states or the order of execution.

You can apply these refactoring strategies to your code base step by step. This approach will help maintain the existing functionality while improving readability, maintainability, and efficiency.
