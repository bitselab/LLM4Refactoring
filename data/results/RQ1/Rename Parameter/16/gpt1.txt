After reviewing the provided code snippet, which is part of the OkHttp library and focuses on WebSocket testing, I identified several areas where refactoring could enhance readability, maintainability, and efficiency. The primary opportunities for refactoring include code duplication reduction, method extraction, and simplifying complex expressions. However, due to the length and complexity of the code, a full refactoring cannot be done in a single response. Below, I'll outline key refactoring strategies and apply them to a portion of the code as an example:

### Refactoring Strategies

1. **Extract Repeated Code into Methods:** Repeated code, especially in the setup of web socket tests, should be extracted into helper methods. This not only reduces duplication but also makes the tests more readable.

2. **Use Descriptive Variable and Method Names:** Ensuring that method and variable names clearly indicate their purpose aids in code readability.

3. **Modularize Large Methods:** Large methods, such as the tests themselves, could be broken down into smaller, more focused methods.

4. **Improve Exception Handling:** Replace generic try-catch blocks with more specific error handling where applicable.

5. **Optimize Imports:** Organize and remove unused imports.

### Example Refactoring

Due to the complexity and size of the code, I'll refactor a small portion as an example. Let's focus on the `textMessage` and `binaryMessage` tests:

```java
@Test public void textMessage() {
    setupWebSocket();
    WebSocket webSocket = newWebSocket();
    clientListener.assertOpen();
    WebSocket server = serverListener.assertOpen();

    webSocket.send("Hello, WebSockets!");
    serverListener.assertTextMessage("Hello, WebSockets!");

    closeWebSockets(webSocket, server);
}

@Test public void binaryMessage() {
    setupWebSocket();
    WebSocket webSocket = newWebSocket();
    clientListener.assertOpen();
    WebSocket server = serverListener.assertOpen();

    webSocket.send(ByteString.encodeUtf8("Hello!"));
    serverListener.assertBinaryMessage(ByteString.of(new byte[] {'H', 'e', 'l', 'l', 'o', '!'}));

    closeWebSockets(webSocket, server);
}

private void setupWebSocket() {
    webServer.enqueue(new MockResponse.Builder()
            .webSocketUpgrade(serverListener)
            .build());
}

private void closeWebSockets(WebSocket webSocket, WebSocket server) {
    webSocket.close(1000, null);
    serverListener.assertClosing(1000, "");
    server.close(1000, null);
    clientListener.assertClosing(1000, "");
    clientListener.assertClosed(1000, "");
    serverListener.assertClosed(1000, "");
}
```

In this refactoring, I've extracted the repeated setup and closing code into their methods. These methods can be reused across different test methods, reducing duplication and making the tests clearer.

### Next Steps

- Apply similar refactoring strategies to other parts of the code.
- Review the entire codebase for consistency in naming conventions and coding styles.
- Consider introducing more granular unit tests if not already present.

It's important to note that refactoring should be done incrementally and tested thoroughly to ensure that no functionality is broken in the process.
