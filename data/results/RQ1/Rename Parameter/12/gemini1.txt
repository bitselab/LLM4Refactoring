The code snippet you provided is well-structured and follows good coding practices. There are no obvious refactoring opportunities at this point. Here are some specific reasons why the code is well-written:

* **Modular functions:** The code breaks down complex tasks into smaller, reusable functions like `findPublicKeyInKeyBox`, `findSecretKeyInLegacySecring`, etc. This improves readability and maintainability.
* **Meaningful variable names:** Variable names like `USER_SECRET_KEY_DIR`, `hasKeyFiles`, etc., clearly describe their purpose. This makes the code easier to understand.
* **Exception handling:** The code uses try-catch blocks to handle potential exceptions like `IOException`, `PGPException`, etc. This makes the code more robust.
* **Comments:** The code includes comments to explain complex logic or non-obvious parts. This improves code readability for developers.

Overall, the code demonstrates good coding practices and doesn't contain any glaring inefficiencies or areas for improvement.
