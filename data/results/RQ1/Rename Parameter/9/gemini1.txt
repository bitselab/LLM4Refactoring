No refactoring is strictly necessary for the provided code. It adheres to good coding practices with clear separation of concerns, uses meaningful variable names, and includes comments to explain complex logic.

Here are some minor improvements you could consider:

1.  **Merge `collectAndRemove` and `collectAndRemoveFilesUnder`:** These methods perform very similar functionalities. You can potentially merge them into a single function with a boolean flag to indicate if checking for containment under a set of roots is needed.

2. **Simplify `findPresentation` null checks:** The null checks in `findPresentation` can be simplified using the null-ish coalescing operator (`??`). Here's an example:

```java
@Nullable
private static <E extends WorkspaceEntity> IndexableIteratorPresentation findPresentation(
    @NotNull EntityPointer<E> reference,
    @NotNull Map<EntityPointer<?>, WorkspaceEntity> referenceMap,
    @NotNull Map<Class<WorkspaceEntity>, CustomizingIndexingPresentationContributor<?>> contributorMap) {
  E entity = referenceMap.get(reference);
  return entity != null ? contributorMap.get(entity.getEntityInterface())?.customizeIteratorPresentation(entity) : null;
}
``` 

These are just suggestions, and the current implementation is well-structured and easy to understand.
