 **I'm ready to review the code and identify potential refactoring opportunities. However, I can't access or execute code directly. I'll provide a comprehensive analysis based on the information available, drawing from my knowledge of best practices and common refactoring patterns.**

**Here's a breakdown of key areas and potential refactoring strategies, incorporating insights from best practices and common patterns:**

**1. Handling Query Types:**

- **Unify Hierarchy:** Explore creating a common abstract base class or interface for query handling methods (`extractWeightedTerms`, `extractWeightedSpanTerms`, etc.) to streamline code and promote reusability.
- **Strategy Pattern:** Consider employing the Strategy pattern to encapsulate query-specific logic within separate classes, enhancing flexibility and testability.

**2. Nested Conditionals:**

- **Early Returns:** Introduce `return` statements within nested `if` blocks to reduce nesting levels and improve readability.
- **Guard Clauses:** Employ guard clauses to validate preconditions early and return promptly if conditions aren't met, simplifying conditional logic.
- **Extract Methods:** Refactor complex conditional logic into well-named, focused methods to enhance code clarity.

**3. Handling Fields:**

- **Combine Field-Related Checks:** Consolidate field-related checks into a dedicated utility method for better organization and potential reuse.
- **Encapsulate Field Logic:** Create a FieldHandler class to encapsulate field-specific behaviors, potentially reducing conditional complexity.

**4. Reader Management:**

- **Centralize Reader Creation:** Introduce a dedicated method to manage `LeafReaderContext` creation for consistent handling and potential optimization.
- **Clearer Reader Purpose:** Consider renaming `internalReader` to a more descriptive name like `highlightingReader` for better clarity.

**5. Caching:**

- **Explicit Caching Strategy:** Define a clear strategy for when to wrap token streams with caching filters, potentially introducing a dedicated CachingFilterFactory class.

**6. Helper Classes:**

- **Review `OffsetLimitTokenFilter`:** Assess its purpose and potential for simplification or integration into other classes.
- **Evaluate `PositionCheckingMap`:** Determine if its functionality can be incorporated into a more general-purpose Map implementation.

**7. Error Handling:**

- **Specific Exception Handling:** Replace generic `IOException` catches with more specific exception types for better error identification and handling.

**Additional Considerations:**

- **Unit Tests:** Ensure thorough unit test coverage to maintain code quality and confidence during refactoring.
- **Code Formatting:** Adhere to consistent code formatting and styling for improved readability and maintainability.
- **Readability:** Prioritize code clarity through meaningful variable names, comments, and adherence to coding conventions.
- **Design Patterns:** Consider applicable design patterns to enhance code structure and modularity.

**Remember that refactoring should be guided by specific goals, such as improving readability, maintainability, testability, or performance. Clearly articulate your objectives before undertaking refactoring efforts.**
