 **While the code effectively demonstrates Java 17 features, I'd recommend these refinements:**

**1. Meaningful Variable Names:**

- Replace single-letter variables with descriptive names:
    - `String stringLength` instead of `s`
    - `Integer integerValue` instead of `i`

**2. Redundant Default Case Removal:**

- Eliminate the redundant default case in `coverageStatement` as it doesn't provide additional value or logic.

**3. Method Consolidation:**

- Merge the `coverage` and `coverageStatement` methods due to their near-identical functionality.

**Here's the refactored code:**

```java
public class ExhaustiveSwitch {

    // ... other code ...

    static int coverageOrStatement(Object o) {
        return switch (o) {
            case String stringLength -> stringLength.length();
            case Integer integerValue -> integerValue;
            default -> 0;
        };
    }

    // ... other code ...

    public static void main(String[] args) {
        System.out.println(coverageOrStatement("a string"));
        System.out.println(coverageOrStatement(42));
        System.out.println(coverageOrStatement(new Object()));

        // ... other code ...
    }
}
```

**Additional Recommendations:**

- **Consistent Formatting and Indentation:** Ensure consistent formatting for better readability.
- **Comments for Clarity:** Add comments to explain complex logic or purpose.
- **Alternative Patterns:** Consider using polymorphism or visitor patterns instead of pattern matching for sealed interfaces, depending on specific use cases.

Remember to prioritize refactorings based on the code's specific goals, implement changes incrementally with thorough testing, and seek team consensus for alignment and maintainability.
