## Refactoring Opportunities in CloudHttp2SolrClient Code

The provided code for `CloudHttp2SolrClient` presents several opportunities for refactoring:

**1. Constructor with Optional Parameters:**

- The constructor has numerous optional parameters. Refactor by using the Builder pattern to improve readability and simplify object creation.

**2. Temporary Flag:**

- The `clientIsInternal` flag is used for conditional resource management. Consider alternatives that make object lifecycles more explicit, potentially removing this flag.

**3. Internal State Duplication:**

- The `myClient` field seems to duplicate functionality provided by `lbClient`. Reassess their roles and consider removing redundancy.

**4. Deprecated Method:**

- The `setParallelCacheRefreshes` method is deprecated and replaced by `withParallelCacheRefreshes`. Remove the deprecated method to avoid confusion.

**5. Naming Conventions:**

- Some fields and variables could benefit from more descriptive names (e.g., `locks` could be renamed to `cacheRefreshLocks`).

**6. Comments and Documentation:**

- While the code has some comments, more detailed documentation would aid understanding and maintainability.

**Refactored Code (using Builder Pattern):**

```java
public class CloudHttp2SolrClient extends CloudSolrClient {

  private final ClusterStateProvider stateProvider;
  private final LBHttp2SolrClient lbClient;

  private CloudHttp2SolrClient(Builder builder) {
    super(builder.shardLeadersOnly, builder.parallelUpdates, builder.directUpdatesToLeadersOnly);
    this.stateProvider = builder.stateProvider;
    this.lbClient = new LBHttp2SolrClient.Builder(builder.buildHttp2Client()).build();
    // ... other initialization logic using builder properties
  }

  // ... other methods

  public static class Builder {
    private Collection<String> zkHosts = new ArrayList<>();
    private List<String> solrUrls = new ArrayList<>();
    private String zkChroot;
    private Http2SolrClient httpClient;
    private boolean shardLeadersOnly = true;
    private boolean directUpdatesToLeadersOnly = false;
    private boolean parallelUpdates = true;
    private ClusterStateProvider stateProvider;
    private Http2SolrClient.Builder internalClientBuilder;
    private RequestWriter requestWriter;
    private ResponseParser responseParser;
    private long retryExpiryTimeNano = TimeUnit.NANOSECONDS.convert(3, TimeUnit.SECONDS);
    private String defaultCollection;
    private long timeToLiveSeconds = 60;
    private int parallelCacheRefreshesLocks = 3;
    private int zkConnectTimeout = SolrZkClientTimeout.DEFAULT_ZK_CONNECT_TIMEOUT;
    private int zkClientTimeout = SolrZkClientTimeout.DEFAULT_ZK_CLIENT_TIMEOUT;
    private boolean canUseZkACLs = true;

    // ... builder methods with setters for various configuration options

    private Http2SolrClient buildHttp2Client() {
      if (httpClient != null) {
        return httpClient;
      } else if (internalClientBuilder != null) {
        return internalClientBuilder.build();
      } else {
        // Use default Http2SolrClient configuration
        return new Http2SolrClient.Builder().build();
      }
    }

    public CloudHttp2SolrClient build() {
      // ... validation logic
      return new CloudHttp2SolrClient(this);
    }
  }
}
```

This refactored code uses the Builder pattern to create `CloudHttp2SolrClient` instances with optional parameters. Additionally, comments are added to explain the purpose of the builder methods.

**Note:** This is a simplified example focusing on the Builder pattern application. Further refactoring opportunities mentioned earlier can be addressed based on your specific needs.
