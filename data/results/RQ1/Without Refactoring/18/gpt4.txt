The code you provided is fairly clean, but there are a few opportunities for improvement, especially in terms of refactoring. Below are my thoughts on each of the suggested refactorings:

### 1. **Extract Class**:  
The class seems to have a single responsibility: managing a cache of `ApplicationHandler` instances. No parts of this class seem to represent distinct responsibilities that would warrant extracting them into separate classes. Therefore, this type of refactoring is **not necessary**.

### 2. **Extract Method**:  
The `computeIfAbsent` method has a small, clear responsibility. It calls the cache's `get` method with a lambda that produces an `ApplicationHandler`. There’s no obvious extraction point within this method itself because the logic is already minimal.

However, it could be argued that the lambda logic inside the `computeIfAbsent` method can be extracted into a dedicated method for better readability.

### 3. **Extract Variable**:  
The method `computeIfAbsent` creates a lambda expression inline. Extracting the lambda into a variable could increase readability, especially if the lambda becomes more complex in the future. 

**Refactoring Opportunity**: Extract the lambda into a named method.

### 4. **Inline Method**:  
The `size` method is just one line of code, which is concise. Inlining this method into wherever it's used might reduce readability. It's fine as is, so **inlining is not needed** here.

### 5. **Inline Variable**:  
The field `applicationByConfigSetId` is assigned inline, and there's no extra variable that needs to be inlined. It is perfectly fine as it is.

### 6. **Rename Attribute**:  
The attribute name `applicationByConfigSetId` is descriptive, but might be a bit long. It’s clear, so renaming is not necessary unless you want to abbreviate it or make it shorter. This is subjective and could be a matter of style preference.

### 7. **Rename Method**:  
The method names like `computeIfAbsent` and `size` are already expressive and conform to standard naming conventions. No renaming is needed.

### 8. **Rename Parameter**:  
The parameter names like `effectiveSolrConfigId` and `createApplicationHandler` are descriptive. However, you could slightly adjust the parameter name `effectiveSolrConfigId` to something like `configSetId` for clarity. This is again, optional but might improve readability.

### 9. **Rename Variable**:  
The variable name `k` in the lambda inside the `computeIfAbsent` method is not ideal. While it's common in lambda expressions, it could be more descriptive. Changing it to something like `configSetId` might make it more readable.

### Refactored Code:

```java
package org.apache.solr.jersey;

import com.github.benmanes.caffeine.cache.Cache;
import com.github.benmanes.caffeine.cache.Caffeine;
import java.util.function.Supplier;
import org.apache.solr.core.SolrConfig;
import org.glassfish.jersey.server.ApplicationHandler;

/**
 * Stores Jersey 'ApplicationHandler' instances by an ID or hash derived from their {@link
 * ConfigSet}.
 *
 * <p>ApplicationHandler creation is expensive; caching these objects allows them to be shared by
 * multiple cores with the same configuration.
 */
public class JerseyAppHandlerCache {

  private final Cache<String, ApplicationHandler> applicationByConfigSetId =
      Caffeine.newBuilder().weakValues().build();

  /**
   * Return the 'ApplicationHandler' associated with the provided ID, creating it first if
   * necessary.
   *
   * <p>This method is thread-safe by virtue of its delegation to {@link Cache#get(Object,
   * Function)} internally.
   *
   * @param configSetId an ID to associate the ApplicationHandler with. Usually created
   *     via {@link SolrConfig#effectiveId()}.
   * @param createApplicationHandler a Supplier producing an ApplicationHandler
   */
  public ApplicationHandler computeIfAbsent(
      String configSetId, Supplier<ApplicationHandler> createApplicationHandler) {
    return applicationByConfigSetId.get(configSetId, this::createHandler);
  }

  private ApplicationHandler createHandler(String configSetId) {
    return createApplicationHandler.get();
  }

  public int size() {
    return applicationByConfigSetId.asMap().size();
  }
}
```

### Summary of Changes:
1. **Renamed `effectiveSolrConfigId` to `configSetId`**: Slightly more concise and clearer.
2. **Renamed lambda parameter `k` to `configSetId`**: Improved readability.
3. **Extracted the lambda expression in `computeIfAbsent` to a `createHandler` method**: This helps maintain readability and prepares the code for potential extension if the lambda becomes more complex.

This refactor mainly improves clarity and readability, while maintaining the structure and functionality of the original code.
