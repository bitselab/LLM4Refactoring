## Refactoring Opportunities in PostStreamingWithPipe

After reviewing the provided code, I identified several potential refactoring opportunities:

**1. Extract Class: "PrimeNumberGenerator"**

The `factor` method within the `streamPrimesToSinkAsynchronously` method has a clear responsibility: calculating the prime factorization of a given number. This functionality can be extracted into a separate class called `PrimeNumberGenerator`. This would improve code organization and make the `streamPrimesToSinkAsynchronously` method more readable.

**2. Extract Method: "writePrimeFactors"**

The loop within the `streamPrimesToSinkAsynchronously` method that writes the prime factors to the sink can be extracted into a separate method called `writePrimeFactors`. This would further improve readability and reduce code duplication.

**3. Extract Variable: "primeNumberString"**

The string formatting within the `writePrimeFactors` method can be extracted into a separate variable called `primeNumberString` to improve readability.

**4. Inline Variable: "primeNumberString"**

Since the `primeNumberString` variable is only used once, it can be inlined directly into the `writeUtf8` call.

**5. Rename Method: "factor" to "getPrimeFactors"**

The `factor` method more accurately reflects its purpose of retrieving prime factors, so renaming it to `getPrimeFactors` would improve clarity.

**6. Rename Parameter: "n" to "number"**

The parameter name "n" in the `getPrimeFactors` method can be renamed to "number" for better readability.

**7. Inline Method: "getPrimeFactors"**

The `getPrimeFactors` method is small and only called once, so it can be inlined directly into the `writePrimeFactors` method.

**8. Rename Attribute: "sink" to "outputStream"**

The attribute name "sink" in the `PipeBody` class can be renamed to "outputStream" to be more descriptive and consistent with common terminology.

**9. Rename Variable: "pipe" to "dataPipe"**

The variable name "pipe" in the `PipeBody` class can be renamed to "dataPipe" to be more descriptive and avoid confusion with the `pipe` method used for inter-thread communication.

        try {
          outputStream.writeUtf8("Numbers\n");
          outputStream.writeUtf8("-------\n");
          for (int i = 2; i <= 997; i++) {
            System.out.println(i);
            Thread.sleep(10);
            writePrimeFactors(outputStream, i);
          }
          outputStream.close();
        } catch (IOException | InterruptedException e) {
          e.printStackTrace();
        }
      }

      private void writePrimeFactors(BufferedSink outputStream, int number) throws IOException {
        for (int i = 2; i < number; i++) {
          int x = number / i;
          if (x * i == number) {
            outputStream.writeUtf8(String.format(" * %d = %s\n", number, getPrimeFactors(x, i)));
            return;
          }
        }
        outputStream.writeUtf8(String.format(" * %d = %d\n", number, number));
      }

      private String getPrimeFactors(int x, int i) {
        return i + " Ã— " + getPrimeFactors(x / i, i);
      }
    };

    thread.start();
  }

  static final class PipeBody extends RequestBody {
    private final Pipe dataPipe = new Pipe(8192);
    private final BufferedSink outputStream = Okio.buffer(dataPipe.sink());

    public BufferedSink outputStream() {
      return outputStream;
    }

    @Override public MediaType contentType() {
      return MEDIA_TYPE_MARKDOWN;
    }

    @Override public void writeTo(BufferedSink sink) throws IOException {
      sink.writeAll(dataPipe.source());
    }
  }

  public static void main(String... args) throws Exception {
    new PostStreamingWithPipe().run();
  }
}
```

## Conclusion

By applying these refactoring techniques, the code becomes more modular, readable, and maintainable.
