The code you provided is generally well-structured, but there are several opportunities to improve its clarity, maintainability, and efficiency. Below are the areas for potential refactoring:

### 1. **Thread Management (Asynchronous Code)**
   - The `Thread` is directly being created using an anonymous subclass, which is generally discouraged. It’s better to use `ExecutorService` for managing threads. This will provide better resource management, control over thread pooling, and improved readability.

### 2. **Exception Handling**
   - The current exception handling prints stack traces directly in the `streamPrimesToSinkAsynchronously` method. Instead, it is a good practice to log exceptions and handle them in a more robust manner, e.g., through a custom exception or rethrowing them.

### 3. **Magic Numbers & Hardcoded Strings**
   - The prime number limit (`997`) is hardcoded in the loop. This should ideally be extracted into a constant or configuration, so it can be easily adjusted.

### 4. **Code Comments**
   - The comments in the `PipeBody` class can be enhanced. While there's a description for the functionality, additional clarifications about the specific design decisions would improve maintainability.

### 5. **Simplification of Thread Code**
   - You can use `Runnable` or lambda expressions for simplicity when using the `ExecutorService` instead of a custom `Thread`.

### Refactoring Highlights:
1. **Thread Management with ExecutorService**: The asynchronous code now uses `ExecutorService` instead of directly creating a `Thread`. This improves thread management and scalability.
   
2. **MAX_PRIME Constant**: The hardcoded `997` value has been replaced with a constant (`MAX_PRIME`), making the code more readable and easier to change.
   
3. **Improved Exception Handling**: Exceptions are now logged using `System.err`, which helps in better tracking of issues without cluttering standard output.
   
4. **Simplified Code**: The anonymous `Thread` is replaced by `executor.submit()`, making the code more concise and readable.

5. **Comment Clarity**: The comment on the `PipeBody` class remains but can be enhanced with further details in a larger context, depending on the specific use case.

This refactor improves readability, thread management, and overall maintainability while keeping the core functionality intact.
