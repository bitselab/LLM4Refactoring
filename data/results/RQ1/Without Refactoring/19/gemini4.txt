## Refactoring Opportunities in JavaInfo Class

After reviewing the provided code, I've identified several potential refactoring opportunities that could improve the code's readability, maintainability, and efficiency. 

### 1. Extract Class: JavaInfo

The `JavaInfo` class acts as a container for various information about the Java environment. However, it only holds data and exposes getter methods. This suggests that it could be refactored into a simple data class. 

**Refactored Code:**

```java
package org.springframework.boot.info;

@Data
public class JavaInfo {

  private final String version;

  private final JavaVendorInfo vendor;

  private final JavaRuntimeEnvironmentInfo runtime;

  private final JavaVirtualMachineInfo jvm;

}
```

### 2. Extract Class: Nested Info Classes

The nested classes `JavaVendorInfo`, `JavaRuntimeEnvironmentInfo`, and `JavaVirtualMachineInfo` also primarily hold data and expose getters. These can also be refactored into data classes.

**Refactored Code:**

```java
package org.springframework.boot.info;

@Data
public static class JavaVendorInfo {

  private final String name;

  private final String version;

}

@Data
public static class JavaRuntimeEnvironmentInfo {

  private final String name;

  private final String version;

}

@Data
public static class JavaVirtualMachineInfo {

  private final String name;

  private final String vendor;

  private final String version;

}
```

### 3. Inline Getters

Since all the fields in the `JavaInfo` and nested info classes are now public due to using the `@Data` annotation, the getter methods are no longer necessary. We can inline them to further simplify the code.

**Refactored Code:**

```java
package org.springframework.boot.info;

@Data
public class JavaInfo {

  public final String version;

  public final JavaVendorInfo vendor;

  public final JavaRuntimeEnvironmentInfo runtime;

  public final JavaVirtualMachineInfo jvm;

}

@Data
public static class JavaVendorInfo {

  public final String name;

  public final String version;

}

@Data
public static class JavaRuntimeEnvironmentInfo {

  public final String name;

  public final String version;

}

@Data
public static class JavaVirtualMachineInfo {

  public final String name;

  public final String vendor;

  public final String version;

}
```

## Conclusion

By applying these refactoring techniques, the code becomes more concise, readable, and easier to maintain. The use of data classes and inlining getters eliminates unnecessary boilerplate code and improves the overall structure of the classes.
