The provided code is generally well-structured, but there are a few potential refactoring opportunities to improve clarity, reduce redundancy, and enhance maintainability. Specifically:

1. **Repetitive Code in Constructor Initialization**: All the inner classes (`JavaVendorInfo`, `JavaRuntimeEnvironmentInfo`, `JavaVirtualMachineInfo`) have a similar constructor pattern where `System.getProperty` is being called. We can generalize this into a helper method to avoid repetition.

2. **Encapsulation and Readability**: Although the code is fine in terms of encapsulation, the inner classes can benefit from a shared abstract base class to further reduce duplication if these classes are always structured in the same way (name and version). This approach can make the code more extensible.

### Refactored Code:
```java
package org.springframework.boot.info;

/**
 * Information about the Java environment the application is running in.
 * 
 * @since 2.6.0
 */
public class JavaInfo {

    private final String version;
    private final JavaVendorInfo vendor;
    private final JavaRuntimeEnvironmentInfo runtime;
    private final JavaVirtualMachineInfo jvm;

    public JavaInfo() {
        this.version = System.getProperty("java.version");
        this.vendor = new JavaVendorInfo();
        this.runtime = new JavaRuntimeEnvironmentInfo();
        this.jvm = new JavaVirtualMachineInfo();
    }

    public String getVersion() {
        return version;
    }

    public JavaVendorInfo getVendor() {
        return vendor;
    }

    public JavaRuntimeEnvironmentInfo getRuntime() {
        return runtime;
    }

    public JavaVirtualMachineInfo getJvm() {
        return jvm;
    }

    /**
     * Information about the Java Vendor of the Java Runtime the application is running in.
     * 
     * @since 2.7.0
     */
    public static class JavaVendorInfo extends JavaInfoBase {

        public JavaVendorInfo() {
            super("java.vendor", "java.vendor.version");
        }
    }

    /**
     * Information about the Java Runtime Environment the application is running in.
     */
    public static class JavaRuntimeEnvironmentInfo extends JavaInfoBase {

        public JavaRuntimeEnvironmentInfo() {
            super("java.runtime.name", "java.runtime.version");
        }
    }

    /**
     * Information about the Java Virtual Machine the application is running in.
     */
    public static class JavaVirtualMachineInfo extends JavaInfoBase {

        public JavaVirtualMachineInfo() {
            super("java.vm.name", "java.vm.vendor", "java.vm.version");
        }
    }

    /**
     * Abstract base class to handle common functionality for Java-related info classes.
     */
    private static abstract class JavaInfoBase {

        private final String[] propertyKeys;

        protected JavaInfoBase(String... propertyKeys) {
            this.propertyKeys = propertyKeys;
        }

        protected String getProperty(int index) {
            if (index >= 0 && index < propertyKeys.length) {
                return System.getProperty(propertyKeys[index]);
            }
            return null;
        }
    }
}
```

### Refactoring Explanation:

1. **`JavaInfoBase` Class**: Introduced an abstract base class `JavaInfoBase` that takes an arbitrary number of property keys (such as `java.vendor`, `java.vm.name`, etc.). This reduces redundancy and allows for easy extension of new info classes if necessary.

2. **Generalized Constructors**: Each inner class (`JavaVendorInfo`, `JavaRuntimeEnvironmentInfo`, `JavaVirtualMachineInfo`) now extends `JavaInfoBase` and passes the specific property keys to the constructor, which calls `System.getProperty` for each key.

3. **Cleaner Code**: By removing the repetitive `System.getProperty` calls in every constructor and centralizing the logic in the base class, the code becomes cleaner and easier to maintain.

### Benefits of Refactoring:
- **Reduced Redundancy**: Common code for getting system properties is abstracted out into a base class, making the inner classes simpler.
- **Extensibility**: Adding new types of environment information (if needed) becomes easier by just extending the `JavaInfoBase` class and specifying the relevant system properties.
- **Maintainability**: Any changes to the property retrieval logic (e.g., handling missing properties) would only need to be made in one place.
