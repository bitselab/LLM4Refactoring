### Refactoring Opportunities:

Upon reviewing the provided code, there are a few areas that could benefit from refactoring to improve readability, reduce repetition, and simplify the logic. Hereâ€™s a breakdown:

1. **Repeated Null Checks for `o1` and `o2`**: The code checks for `null` multiple times for both `o1` and `o2`. These checks are somewhat repetitive, and they can be consolidated into a more streamlined approach.

2. **Duplicated `null` and `toString()` Checks**: There are repeated checks for `null` on the `toString()` results for both objects. This can also be simplified.

### Refactored Code:

```java
package org.apache.commons.lang3.compare;

import java.io.Serializable;
import java.util.Comparator;

/**
 * Compares Object's {@link Object#toString()} values.
 *
 * This class is stateless.
 *
 * @since 3.10
 */
public final class ObjectToStringComparator implements Comparator<Object>, Serializable {

    /**
     * Singleton instance.
     *
     * This class is stateless.
     */
    public static final ObjectToStringComparator INSTANCE = new ObjectToStringComparator();

    /**
     * For {@link Serializable}.
     */
    private static final long serialVersionUID = 1L;

    @Override
    public int compare(final Object o1, final Object o2) {
        if (o1 == o2) {
            return 0; // If both are the same object or both null, return 0
        }

        String string1 = (o1 != null) ? o1.toString() : null;
        String string2 = (o2 != null) ? o2.toString() : null;

        // Handle null values in toString() results
        if (string1 == null) {
            return (string2 == null) ? 0 : 1;
        }
        if (string2 == null) {
            return -1;
        }

        return string1.compareTo(string2);
    }
}
```

### Refactoring Details:

1. **Optimized Null Check for `o1` and `o2`**:
   - Instead of performing multiple null checks for `o1` and `o2`, we check if `o1 == o2` early on. This handles the case where both objects are either the same instance or both `null`, returning `0` directly.
   - This eliminates the need to check null on both `o1` and `o2` multiple times.

2. **Simplified Null Handling for `toString()`**:
   - If `o1` or `o2` is `null`, we handle the `toString()` call more concisely by using the ternary operator.
   - We ensure that `null` values for `toString()` are handled properly by comparing the results (`string1` and `string2`) directly, reducing repetitive code.

3. **Overall Code Reduction**:
   - The number of conditional checks is reduced, making the logic more readable and easier to maintain. This also avoids redundant code, particularly around `null` and `toString()` checks.

### Summary:

This refactor simplifies the code by consolidating and reducing redundant null checks and comparisons, improving the clarity and maintainability of the comparator logic while preserving the original functionality.
