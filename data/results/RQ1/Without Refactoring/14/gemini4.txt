## Refactoring Opportunities in CachingTokenFilter

After reviewing the provided code snippet, I identified several potential refactoring opportunities:

### 1. Extract Method: `fillCache()`

The `fillCache()` method is responsible for reading and caching all tokens from the input stream. This logic is well-defined and could be extracted into a separate method for improved readability and maintainability.

**Refactored code:**

```java
private void fillCache() throws IOException {
  while (input.incrementToken()) {
    cache.add(captureState());
  }
  // capture final state
  input.end();
  finalState = captureState();
}

// Extracted method
private void readAndCacheTokens() throws IOException {
  while (input.incrementToken()) {
    cache.add(captureState());
  }
}
```

### 2. Inline Variable: `finalState`

The `finalState` variable is only used once, within the `end()` method. Inlining this variable would reduce memory usage and improve code clarity.

**Refactored code:**

```java
@Override
public final void end() {
  if (cache != null) {
    restoreState(captureState());
  }
}
```

### 3. Rename Method: `restoreState`

The `restoreState` method name is not very descriptive. Renaming it to `applyState` would better reflect its purpose.

**Refactored code:**

```java
// ...

private void applyState(AttributeSource.State state) {
  // ...
}

// ...

@Override
public final void end() {
  if (cache != null) {
    applyState(captureState());
  }
}
```

### 4. Extract Variable: `cacheSize`

The initial size of the `cache` list is hardcoded as `64`. Extracting this value into a variable would improve flexibility and maintainability.

**Refactored code:**

```java
private static final int INITIAL_CACHE_SIZE = 64;

// ...

if (cache == null) { // first-time
  // fill cache lazily
  cache = new ArrayList<>(INITIAL_CACHE_SIZE);
  readAndCacheTokens();
  iterator = cache.iterator();
}
```

## Conclusion

By applying these refactoring techniques, the code becomes more readable, maintainable, and flexible. The extracted methods encapsulate specific functionalities, while inlining the `finalState` variable reduces memory usage. Renaming the `restoreState` method improves clarity, and extracting the `cacheSize` value enhances flexibility.
