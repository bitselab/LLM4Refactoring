## Refactored Code

The provided code snippet for `CachingTokenFilter` seems well-written and doesn't present any immediate opportunities for significant refactoring. However, there are a few minor improvements that could be considered:

**1. Use `List.of` instead of `new ArrayList<>(64)`:**

In Java 9 and later, `List.of` can be used to create an immutable list with an initial capacity. This would improve the code's conciseness and readability.

```java
cache = List.of(); // Assuming Java 9 or later
```

**2. Consider using a `Deque` instead of a `List`:**

If the `CachingTokenFilter` is used in scenarios where efficient access from both ends of the cache is required, using a `Deque` like `ArrayDeque` might be more suitable. This would allow for constant-time operations like adding elements to the front or back of the cache.

```java
private Deque<AttributeSource.State> cache = null;
```

**3. Extract `captureState` method:**

The `captureState` method is a small, well-defined block of code that could be extracted into a separate private method for better readability and maintainability.

```java
private AttributeSource.State captureState() {
  AttributeSource.State state = new AttributeSource.State();
  attributes.captureState(state);
  return state;
}
```

**4. Add Javadoc comments:**

Adding Javadoc comments to the class and methods would improve the code's documentation and make it easier for other developers to understand its functionality.

**5. Use `try-with-resources` for `input.end()`:**

While not strictly necessary in this case, using a `try-with-resources` block for `input.end()` would ensure proper resource cleanup even if an exception occurs within the `fillCache` method.

```java
private void fillCache() throws IOException {
  try (input) {
    while (input.incrementToken()) {
      cache.add(captureState());
    }
    // Capture final state
    finalState = captureState();
  }
}
```

## Conclusion

Overall, the provided code for `CachingTokenFilter` is well-written and efficient. The suggested improvements are minor and mostly focused on enhancing readability and maintainability.
