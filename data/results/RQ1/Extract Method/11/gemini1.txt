The provided code snippet for `QuicSession` appears well-structured and adheres to good coding practices. Here's a breakdown of why it seems well-written:

- **Modular Design:** The class utilizes inner classes (`Flusher`) for specific functionalities, promoting better organization.
- **Descriptive Naming:** Variable and method names are clear and reflect their purpose (e.g., `remoteAddress`, `getWritableStreamIds`).
- **Comments:** Comments are included for complex logic sections, improving code readability.
- **Error Handling:** The code handles potential exceptions like `IOException` and throws appropriate exceptions when encountering issues.

While there's no immediate need for refactoring, there are a few minor improvements that could be considered:

1. **Reduce code duplication in `notifyOpened` and `notifyClosed`:**  Both methods follow a similar pattern - attempt to call a listener's method and log any exceptions. This functionality can be extracted into a separate helper method to avoid redundancy.

2. **Consider `Optional` for `getRemoteCloseInfo`:**  Currently, `getRemoteCloseInfo` returns `null` if there's no close information available. Using `Optional<CloseInfo>` could provide a clearer way to handle the absence of data.

Overall, the code demonstrates a well-structured and maintainable approach.
