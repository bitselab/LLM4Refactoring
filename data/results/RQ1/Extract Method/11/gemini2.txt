Absolutely, there is a refactoring opportunity in the provided code for the `QuicSession` class. The identified refactoring technique is **Extract Method**.

Here's the breakdown:

- The current `process` method performs multiple responsibilities:
    1. Updates `remoteAddress`
    2. Feeds data to `quicheConnection`
    3. Handles connection established logic
    4. Flushes data

- We can extract a new method to handle logic related to feeding data to `quicheConnection` and updating connection state based on the established flag. 

Here's the refactored code with the extracted method:

```java
public class QuicSession extends ContainerLifeCycle {
  // ... other class members ...

  public Runnable process(SocketAddress remoteAddress, ByteBuffer cipherBufferIn) throws IOException {
    this.remoteAddress = remoteAddress;

    int remaining = cipherBufferIn.remaining();
    if (LOG.isDebugEnabled()) {
      LOG.debug("feeding {} cipher bytes to {}", remaining, this);
    }
    int accepted = quicheConnection.feedCipherBytes(cipherBufferIn, getLocalAddress(), remoteAddress);
    if (accepted != remaining) {
      throw new IllegalStateException();
    }

    return handleConnectionEstablished(isConnectionEstablished());
  }

  private Runnable handleConnectionEstablished(boolean connectionEstablished) throws IOException {
    if (connectionEstablished) {
      ProtocolSession protocol = protocolSession;
      if (protocol == null) {
        protocolSession = protocol = createProtocolSession();
        addManaged(protocol);
      }

      if (LOG.isDebugEnabled()) {
        LOG.debug("processing {}", protocol);
      }
      // Return a task because we want 1 thread per QUIC connection ID.
      return protocol.getProducerTask();
    } else {
      flush();
      return null;
    }
  }

  // ... other methods ...
}
```

This refactoring improves code readability and maintainability by separating concerns within the `process` method. The new `handleConnectionEstablished` method clearly handles the logic related to connection state and avoids code duplication.
