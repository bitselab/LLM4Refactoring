Here's a potential refactoring opportunity using the Extract Method technique in the provided code:

The `DState#nextState` method performs several calculations and assignments related to determining the next state for a given character class. This logic can be extracted into a separate method to improve readability and maintainability.

Here's the refactored code:

```java
private class DState {
  // ... other fields and methods

  private int determineNextState(int charClass) {
    initTransitions();
    if (transitions[charClass] == NOT_COMPUTED) {
      assignTransition(charClass, findDState(step(points[charClass])));
      // Update transitions to the left and right if minimalTransition exists
      if (minimalTransition != null) {
        updateLeftAndRightTransitions(charClass);
        minimalTransition = null;
      }
    }
    return transitions[charClass];
  }

  private void updateLeftAndRightTransitions(int charClass) {
    int cls = charClass;
    while (cls > 0 && points[--cls] >= minimalTransition.min) {
      assert transitions[cls] == NOT_COMPUTED || transitions[cls] == transitions[charClass];
      assignTransition(cls, transitions[charClass]);
    }
    cls = charClass;
    while (cls < points.length - 1 && points[++cls] <= minimalTransition.max) {
      assert transitions[cls] == NOT_COMPUTED || transitions[cls] == transitions[charClass];
      assignTransition(cls, transitions[charClass]);
    }
  }

  // ... other methods
}
```

The original logic within `nextState` is now encapsulated in the new `determineNextState` method. This improves code organization and makes the purpose of the logic more explicit.

It's important to note that this is just one potential refactoring opportunity. Further analysis might reveal additional improvements based on your specific coding standards and project requirements.
