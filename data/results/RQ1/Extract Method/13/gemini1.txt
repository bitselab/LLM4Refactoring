## Refactoring Opportunities in AutoCloseTests.java

Here are some refactoring opportunities in the provided code:

**1. Extract Test Method Assertions:**

Several test methods (`assertFailingWithMessage`, `assertMissingCloseMethod`)  share similar logic for asserting failures with specific messages.  We can extract this logic into a separate helper method to improve readability and maintainability.

**2. Refactor recorder usage:**

The `recorder` list is a static field and might lead to unintended side effects if multiple tests are run concurrently. Consider using a thread-local variable or a different approach to isolate recorder data for each test.

**3. Organize Test Classes:**

There are many subclasses extending other test classes with similar structures. Consider using a single base class with abstract methods or interfaces to reduce code duplication.

**Here's an example of refactoring the `assertFailingWithMessage` method:**

```java
private static void assertFailingTest(Events testEvents, String msg) {
  testEvents
      .assertStatistics(stats -> stats.failed(1))
      .assertThatEvents().haveExactly(1, finishedWithFailure(message(msg)));
}
```

This refactored method can be reused throughout the class to simplify assertions.

**Refactoring the recorder usage and test class organization would require a more significant code restructuring. It's recommended to analyze the specific needs and test execution environment before implementing those changes.**

**Overall, the code is well-structured and includes comments explaining the logic. The suggested refactorings are focused on improving maintainability and reducing duplication.**
