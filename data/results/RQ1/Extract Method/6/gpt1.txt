In the provided code snippet, a clear opportunity for refactoring is observed in the repetitive pattern of file creation for tests. This pattern appears in several methods and involves creating a file name, generating file content, and creating a file with that content in the Azure Blob FileSystem. Extracting this repeated pattern into a separate method will improve the readability and maintainability of the code.

The repeated code snippet is:
```java
String fileName = methodName.getMethodName() + fileIdx;
byte[] fileContent = getRandomBytesArray(fileSize);
Path testFilePath = createFileWithContent(fs, fileName, fileContent);
```

Here's how the refactored code would look:

Refactored Method:
```java
private Path createTestFile(AzureBlobFileSystem fs, String methodName, int fileIdx, int fileSize) throws IOException {
    String fileName = methodName + fileIdx;
    byte[] fileContent = getRandomBytesArray(fileSize);
    return createFileWithContent(fs, fileName, fileContent);
}
```

Refactoring in Context:
I'll refactor one of the methods (`testNumBackendCalls`) to demonstrate how this new method can be used.

```java
private void testNumBackendCalls(boolean optimizeFooterRead) throws Exception {
    int fileIdx = 0;
    for (int i = 0; i <= 4; i++) {
        for (int j = 0; j <= 2; j++) {
            int fileSize = (int) Math.pow(2, i) * 256 * ONE_KB;
            int footerReadBufferSize = (int) Math.pow(2, j) * 256 * ONE_KB;
            final AzureBlobFileSystem fs = getFileSystem(optimizeFooterRead, fileSize);
            Path testFilePath = createTestFile(fs, methodName.getMethodName(), fileIdx++, fileSize);
            // Rest of the method logic...
        }
    }
}
```

In this refactoring:
- The repetitive file creation code is encapsulated into the `createTestFile` method.
- This method is used in place of the repeated snippet in the `testNumBackendCalls` method.
- The same refactoring should be applied to all other methods where the repetitive code snippet appears.

For a complete refactoring, replace all instances of the original snippet with calls to `createTestFile` in each method where the snippet is used. This change will make the code more maintainable and adhere to the DRY (Don't Repeat Yourself) principle.
