Reviewing the provided code snippet, I identify a clear opportunity for the "Extract Method" refactoring. The repeated code snippet involved in creating a file in the Azure Blob File System is a prime candidate. This snippet appears in multiple methods and can be refactored into its own method to improve code readability and maintainability.

The snippet to be refactored is:

```java
String fileName = methodName.getMethodName() + fileIdx;
byte[] fileContent = getRandomBytesArray(fileSize);
Path testFilePath = createFileWithContent(fs, fileName, fileContent);
```

This snippet can be encapsulated into a private method, which I'll name `createTestFileWithPath`. Here's how the refactored code would look:

Refactored Method:

```java
private Path createTestFileWithPath(AzureBlobFileSystem fs, String methodName, int fileIdx, int fileSize) throws IOException {
    String fileName = methodName + fileIdx;
    byte[] fileContent = getRandomBytesArray(fileSize);
    return createFileWithContent(fs, fileName, fileContent);
}
```

Refactoring in Context:

I'll refactor one of the methods to demonstrate how this new method can be used. Due to the length of the code, I'll only refactor the `testNumBackendCalls` method as an example.

```java
private void testNumBackendCalls(boolean optimizeFooterRead) throws Exception {
    int fileIdx = 0;
    for (int i = 0; i <= 4; i++) {
        for (int j = 0; j <= 2; j++) {
            int fileSize = (int) Math.pow(2, i) * 256 * ONE_KB;
            int footerReadBufferSize = (int) Math.pow(2, j) * 256 * ONE_KB;
            final AzureBlobFileSystem fs = getFileSystem(optimizeFooterRead, fileSize);
            Path testFilePath = createTestFileWithPath(fs, methodName.getMethodName(), fileIdx++, fileSize);
            // Rest of the method logic...
        }
    }
}
```

This refactoring encapsulates the file creation process into a separate method, thereby adhering to the DRY (Don't Repeat Yourself) principle. You would apply the same refactoring to all other methods where this repeated code snippet appears.

For a complete refactoring, you would need to replace all instances of the original snippet with calls to the new `createTestFileWithPath` method. This will make the code more maintainable and easier to understand.
