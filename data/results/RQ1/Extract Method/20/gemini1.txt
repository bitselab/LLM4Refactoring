In this code, there are a few opportunities for refactoring:

1. **Extract method for `isBridgedCandidateFor`:** The logic for checking if a method is a candidate for being bridged is used in multiple places. This can be extracted into a separate method to improve readability and reduce code duplication.

2. **Simplify null checks:** There are multiple redundant null checks throughout the code. These can be simplified using the null-safe operator (`?.`) introduced in Java 11 (or conditional statements if targeting older Java versions).

3. **Combine search methods:** The methods `searchForMatch` and `searchInterfaces` have very similar logic. These can be potentially combined into a single method with conditional logic to handle searching both classes and interfaces.

Here's the refactored code with the suggested improvements (assuming Java 11):

/**
 * Helper for resolving synthetic {@link Method#isBridge bridge Methods} to the
 * {@link Method} being bridged.
 *
 * <p>Given a synthetic {@link Method#isBridge bridge Method} returns the {@link Method}
 * being bridged. A bridge method may be created by the compiler when extending a
 * parameterized type whose methods have parameterized arguments. During runtime
 * invocation the bridge {@link Method} may be invoked and/or used via reflection.
 * When attempting to locate annotations on {@link Method Methods}, it is wise to check
 * for bridge {@link Method Methods} as appropriate and find the bridged {@link Method}.
 *
 * <p>See <a href="https://java.sun.com/docs/books/jls/third_edition/html/expressions.html#15.12.4.5">
 * The Java Language Specification</a> for more details on the use of bridge methods.
