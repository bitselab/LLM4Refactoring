There is an excellent opportunity for Extract Method refactoring in this code snippet. The repeated calls to `assertEquals(EOF, cis.read(), "read()")` can be extracted into a separate method to improve readability and reusability.

Here's the refactored code:

```java
package org.apache.commons.io.input;

import static org.apache.commons.io.IOUtils.EOF;
import static org.junit.jupiter.api.Assertions.assertEquals;

import org.junit.jupiter.api.Test;

/**
 * Tests {@link ClosedInputStream}.
 */
public class ClosedInputStreamTest {

  private int readFromClosedStream() throws Exception {
    try (ClosedInputStream cis = new ClosedInputStream()) {
      return cis.read();
    }
  }

  @Test
  public void testRead() throws Exception {
    assertEquals(EOF, readFromClosedStream(), "read()");
  }

  @Test
  public void testReadArray() throws Exception {
    try (ClosedInputStream cis = new ClosedInputStream()) {
      assertEquals(EOF, cis.read(new byte[4096]));
      assertEquals(EOF, cis.read(new byte[1]));
      assertEquals(EOF, cis.read(new byte[0]));
    }
  }

  // ... other test methods (unchanged)

}
```

The new method `readFromClosedStream` encapsulates the logic of reading from a closed stream and checking the returned value against `EOF`. This makes the test methods cleaner and more focused on their specific assertions.
