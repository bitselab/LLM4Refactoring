 **I'm unable to directly access or execute code, but I can provide insights based on software development best practices and refactoring principles.**

**Here's a comprehensive response, combining code analysis with refactoring suggestions for potential improvements:**

**Overall Impressions:**

- **Clear Class Structure:** The code has a well-defined structure and naming conventions, making it easier to understand.
- **Common Functionality:** It encapsulates common transform-related operations, promoting reusability.
- **Error Handling:** It includes basic error handling, essential for resilience.

**Potential Refactoring Opportunities:**

1. **Extract Cohesive Helper Methods:** Identify frequently used code blocks or related logic and group them into separate helper methods to enhance readability and maintainability.
2. **Reduce Duplication:** Look for redundant code snippets and create reusable functions to reduce complexity and prevent inconsistencies.
3. **Apply Design Patterns:** Consider using design patterns like the Factory pattern for creating TransformConfig objects or the Strategy pattern for varying transformation logic based on configuration.
4. **Improve Parameter Handling:** Explore using more descriptive or type-safe parameters to make the code less error-prone and easier to understand.
5. **Enhance Error Handling:** Strengthen error handling mechanisms by providing more informative messages and considering alternative actions, such as:
    - Retrying failed operations
    - Logging errors for debugging
    - Notifying users about issues
6. **Consider Logging:** Add logging to track execution flow, debug issues, and monitor performance.
7. **Break Down Large Methods:** Decompose lengthy methods into smaller, well-defined functions for better readability and testability.
8. **Consider Alternative Data Structures:** Explore using data structures that better align with the code's usage patterns to potentially improve performance or memory efficiency.
9. **Add Comments and Documentation:** Enhance clarity by adding comments to explain complex logic and create comprehensive documentation for future reference.

**Specific Refactoring Suggestions (based on code analysis):**

- The `createGroupConfig` and `createAggConfig` methods could be refactored to avoid manual JSON serialization and deserialization.
- The `waitForCheckpoint` method could be made more flexible by accepting a custom check function for determining checkpoint completion.

**Remember:** Refactoring should always be guided by clear goals and maintain code correctness. Assess the trade-offs between potential improvements and implementation effort.
