No further refactoring is necessary based on the provided information. 

The previous iterations identified and addressed the following potential improvements:

1. **`length` to `remainingBytesInContinuation`**: This clarifies the variable's purpose within the context of continuation frames.
2. **`state` to `continuationParsingState`**: This provides a more specific name for the state of the continuation frame parsing process.
3. **`buffer` to `continuationPayload`**: This clarifies the usage of the buffer specifically for continuation frames.

These changes enhance code readability without introducing unnecessary modifications. 

The remaining variables (`headerBlockParser`, `headerBlockFragments`, etc.) have clear and concise names that reflect their purpose within the code.
