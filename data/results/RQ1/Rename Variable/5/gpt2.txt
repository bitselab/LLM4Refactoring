After reviewing the provided code for rename variable refactoring opportunities, it appears that the variable names used are already quite descriptive and appropriate for their context. The names `stateIndex`, `stateTtl`, `stateName`, and others like `stateMetadataList`, `stateTtlFromHint`, `inputNumOfOperator` are clear in their purpose and usage, which is crucial for code readability and maintainability.

However, there's always room for minor improvements in terms of clarity and consistency. For instance:
- `stateTtl` and `stateRetentionTime` both represent durations, but their names might suggest different types or purposes. It might be more consistent to name them similarly.
- `stateMetadataList` could be renamed to clarify that it's a list of metadata for multiple states, like `multipleStatesMetadata`.

Let's make these minor adjustments for consistency and clarity, even though the original names are already quite good. Here's the refactored code with these changes:

```java
package org.apache.flink.table.planner.plan.nodes.exec;

// ... [imports remain unchanged]

@Internal
@JsonIgnoreProperties(ignoreUnknown = true)
public class StateMetadata {
    // ... [constant definitions remain unchanged]

    @JsonProperty(value = FIELD_NAME_STATE_INDEX, index = 0)
    private final int stateIndex;

    @JsonProperty(value = FIELD_NAME_STATE_TTL, index = 1)
    private final Duration stateDuration;  // Renamed from stateTtl

    @JsonProperty(value = FIELD_NAME_STATE_NAME, index = 2)
    private final String stateName;

    // ... [constructor and other method signatures remain unchanged]

    public StateMetadata(int stateIndex, Duration stateDuration, String stateName) {
        Preconditions.checkArgument(stateIndex >= 0, "state index should start from 0");
        this.stateIndex = stateIndex;
        this.stateDuration = Preconditions.checkNotNull(stateDuration, "state duration should not be null");
        this.stateName = Preconditions.checkNotNull(stateName, "state name should not be null");
    }

    // ... [other methods remain unchanged]

    @JsonGetter(value = FIELD_NAME_STATE_TTL)
    public String getStateDurationAsString() {  // Renamed from getStateTtl
        return TimeUtils.formatWithHighestUnit(stateDuration);
    }

    // ... [other static methods remain unchanged]

    public static List<StateMetadata> getMultiInputOperatorDefaultMeta(
            Map<Integer, Long> stateDurationHints,  // Renamed from stateTtlFromHint
            ReadableConfig tableConfig,
            String... stateNameList) {
        Duration defaultStateDuration = tableConfig.get(ExecutionConfigOptions.IDLE_STATE_RETENTION);  // Renamed for clarity
        List<StateMetadata> multipleStatesMetadata = new ArrayList<>(stateNameList.length);  // Renamed from stateMetadataList
        for (int i = 0; i < stateNameList.length; i++) {
            Duration specificStateDuration = stateDurationHints.containsKey(i)
                            ? Duration.ofMillis(stateDurationHints.get(i))
                            : defaultStateDuration;
            multipleStatesMetadata.add(new StateMetadata(i, specificStateDuration, stateNameList[i]));
        }
        return multipleStatesMetadata;
    }

    // ... [remaining methods remain unchanged]

    @Override
    public boolean equals(Object o) {
        if (this == o) return true;
        if (!(o instanceof StateMetadata)) return false;
        StateMetadata that = (StateMetadata) o;
        return stateIndex == that.stateIndex
                && stateDuration.equals(that.stateDuration)
                && stateName.equals(that.stateName);
    }

    // ... [hashCode and other methods remain unchanged]
}
```

The changes are:


- Renamed `stateTtl` to `stateDuration` for better clarity and consistency.
- Changed the method `getStateTtl` to `getStateDurationAsString` to reflect the renaming and its functionality.
- Renamed `stateTtlFromHint` to `stateDurationHints` to indicate it's a collection of duration hints.
- Renamed `stateMetadataList` to `multipleStatesMetadata` in `getMultiInputOperatorDefaultMeta` to indicate it contains metadata for multiple states.

These changes are minor and aim to enhance clarity and consistency. The original names were already well-chosen, making these adjustments more about fine-tuning rather than essential improvements.
