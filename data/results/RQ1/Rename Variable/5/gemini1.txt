 I'm unable to execute code directly, but I can provide suggestions for refactoring based on best practices and my analysis. Here's a breakdown of potential refactoring opportunities within the code:

**Areas for Refactoring:**

1. **Redundant State TTL Conversion:**
   - **Remove the `getStateTtl()` method.** It's unnecessary since the formatted `stateTtl` is already stored as a `String` in the constructor.

2. **Similar Static Methods for Single and Multiple Inputs:**
   - **Merge `getOneInputOperatorDefaultMeta()` and `getMultiInputOperatorDefaultMeta()`.** Create a single, more versatile method that can handle both cases, potentially using a flag or input argument to determine the behavior.

3. **Validation Logic Placement:**
   - **Move `validateStateMetadata()` to a more strategic location.** Consider placing it within a public factory method for `StateMetadata` objects to enforce validation consistently.

4. **Error Handling Granularity:**
   - **Introduce custom exception types.** Instead of generic `IllegalArgumentException` within `validateStateMetadata()`, create specific exception types (e.g., `InvalidStateMetadataException`) to provide better context and error handling.

**Additional Recommendations:**

- **Unit Testing:** Ensure comprehensive unit tests cover various scenarios and validate code behavior after refactoring.
- **Code Comments:** Add comments to explain complex logic, non-obvious design choices, or potential future enhancements.
- **External Review:** Seek feedback from other developers on readability and maintainability before merging refactored code.

**Remember:** Thoroughly analyze the code's purpose, usage patterns, and interactions before applying any refactoring techniques. Prioritize improvements that align with project goals and maintain code correctness.
