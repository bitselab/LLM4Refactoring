In the provided code, there are a few potential refactoring opportunities, but none are major changes. Here's what you can consider:

1. **Descriptive Variable Names:**

   - Consider using more descriptive names for some variables, especially those that aren't immediately clear. 
   For example, `count1`, `count2`, and `count3` could be renamed to `bytesRead1`, `bytesRead2`, and `bytesRead3` to better reflect their purpose.

2. **Extract Magic Numbers:**

   - The number `10` is used in a couple of places (e.g., `mark(10)`). If this value has a specific meaning, consider extracting it into a constant with a descriptive name for better readability.

3. **Early Return in `testReadByteArray`:**

   - In the `testReadByteArray` method, after encountering the end of the stream (`count3 == -1`), you can potentially include an `if` statement and directly return to avoid the subsequent `assertThrows`. This might improve readability slightly.

It's important to consider the trade-offs of these refactorings. While they can improve readability, extensive changes might not be necessary if the current code is well-understood by the team.

I cannot directly modify the code to reflect these suggestions, but I've highlighted areas for potential improvement if you decide to refactor.
