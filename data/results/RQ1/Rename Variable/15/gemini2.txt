 I've reviewed the code snippet, and while the variable names are generally descriptive, there are a few opportunities for rename variable refactoring to further enhance readability:

1. **SESSION**: This variable is used specifically for storing a Mockito session, so a more specific name like `mockitoSession` would be more informative.

2. **MOCKS**: This variable holds a collection of mocks. However, since it's within a Mockito extension, it's clear that it's related to Mockito. Renaming it to `mockitoMocks` could make its purpose even clearer.

Here's the refactored code with those changes:

```java
package org.mockito.junit.jupiter;

// ... (other imports)

public class MockitoExtension implements BeforeEachCallback, AfterEachCallback, ParameterResolver {

  private final static Namespace MOCKITO_NAMESPACE = create("org.mockito");

  private final static String MOCKITO_SESSION = "mockitoSession", MOCKITO_MOCKS = "mockitoMocks";

  // ... (other code remains the same)

  @Override
  public void beforeEach(final ExtensionContext context) {
    // ...
    context.getStore(MOCKITO_NAMESPACE).put(MOCKITO_MOCKS, new HashSet<>());
    context.getStore(MOCKITO_NAMESPACE).put(MOCKITO_SESSION, session);
  }

  // ... (other code remains the same)

  @Override
  public void afterEach(ExtensionContext context) {
    // ...
    context.getStore(MOCKITO_NAMESPACE).remove(MOCKITO_MOCKS, Set.class).forEach(mock -> ((ScopedMock) mock).closeOnDemand());
    context.getStore(MOCKITO_NAMESPACE).remove(MOCKITO_SESSION, MockitoSession.class)
        .finishMocking(context.getExecutionException().orElse(null));
  }
}
```

These changes make the code slightly more descriptive, especially for developers less familiar with Mockito.
