 **I've identified several refactoring opportunities within the provided code:**

1. **Consolidate Overly-Similar Methods:**
   - The methods `readFully(InputStream fd, byte[] dst, int off, int len)` and `readFully(InputStream fd, byte[] dst)` have very similar content and could be combined into a single method with appropriate default values for `off` and `len`.
2. **Simplify Overloading:**
   - The methods `readSome(File path, int limit)` and `readFully(File path, int max)` could potentially be combined into a single method with a boolean flag indicating whether to throw an exception if the file exceeds the limit.
3. **Break Up Large Methods:**
   - The methods `readLine(Reader in, int sizeHint)` and `readLines(String s)` are relatively long and could be made more readable by breaking them down into smaller, more focused methods.
4. **Consider Parameter Objects:**
   - For methods like `readFully(File path, int max)`, introducing a `FileReadOptions` object to hold parameters like path and max could improve readability and flexibility.
5. **Streamline Error Handling:**
   - The error handling logic for `readFully` methods can be simplified by centralizing the exception handling in a common helper method.
6. **Utilize Functional Programming:**
   - The code could potentially benefit from using Java's Stream API for tasks like reading lines from a string (`readLines` method).
7. **Leverage Modern Java Features:**
   - If applicable, consider using newer Java features like `Files.readAllBytes(path)` or `Files.readString(path)`.

**Here's a partially refactored example incorporating some of these suggestions:**

```java
// Note: Refactored code is illustrative and may need further adjustments for best practices.
public class IO {

    private IO() {}

    public static byte[] readFully(InputStream fd, byte[] dst, int off, int len) throws IOException {
        return readFully(fd, dst, off, len, true); // Call a more general method with default exception behavior
    }

    public static byte[] readFully(InputStream fd, byte[] dst) throws IOException {
        return readFully(fd, dst, 0, dst.length, true); // Combines logic from multiple methods
    }

    private static byte[] readFully(InputStream fd, byte[] dst, int off, int len, boolean throwExceptionOnEOF) throws IOException {
        // ...
    }

    public static byte[] readFile(File path, int maxBytes, boolean throwExceptionIfTooLarge) throws IOException {
        // ...
    }

    // ... other refactored methods
}
```

I recommend carefully reviewing the code's context and usage patterns to determine the most impactful refactoring actions while maintaining clarity and functionality.
