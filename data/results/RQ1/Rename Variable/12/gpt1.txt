The provided code snippet from the `org.eclipse.jgit.util.IO` class appears to be well-structured and follows good coding practices. However, there are a few potential refactoring opportunities that could enhance readability, maintainability, and performance. Here's a refactored version of the code with explanations for the changes:

1. **Consolidate Duplicate Code:** The methods `readFully(File path)` and `readFully(File path, int max)` have overlapping functionality. This can be refactored to avoid duplication.

2. **Use Standard Java Libraries:** The method `readWholeStream` can leverage standard Java libraries more efficiently. For instance, it could use a `ByteArrayOutputStream` to handle dynamic buffer resizing.

3. **Improve Exception Handling:** Some methods could benefit from more specific exception handling, providing clearer information about the error condition.

4. **Enhance Readability:** Some methods, such as `readLines`, could be refactored for better readability. For example, using Java Streams can make the code more concise and readable.

5. **Optimize Buffer Management:** In methods like `readLine`, buffer management can be optimized to reduce memory footprint and improve performance.

Here's how the refactored code might look:

```java
package org.eclipse.jgit.util;

import java.io.*;
import java.nio.ByteBuffer;
import java.nio.channels.ReadableByteChannel;
import java.text.MessageFormat;
import java.util.ArrayList;
import java.util.List;
import java.util.stream.Collectors;
import java.util.stream.Stream;

import org.eclipse.jgit.internal.JGitText;
import org.eclipse.jgit.util.io.SilentFileInputStream;

public class IO {
    
    // ... [Other methods remain unchanged] ...

    public static final byte[] readFully(File path, int max) throws FileNotFoundException, IOException {
        if (max < 0) {
            throw new IllegalArgumentException("max must be non-negative");
        }
        try (SilentFileInputStream in = new SilentFileInputStream(path)) {
            return readStreamFully(in, max);
        }
    }

    private static byte[] readStreamFully(InputStream in, int max) throws IOException {
        ByteArrayOutputStream out = new ByteArrayOutputStream();
        byte[] buffer = new byte[Math.min(max, 1024)];
        int bytesRead;
        int totalRead = 0;
        while ((bytesRead = in.read(buffer)) != -1) {
            if (totalRead + bytesRead > max) {
                throw new IOException(MessageFormat.format(JGitText.get().fileIsTooLarge, max));
            }
            out.write(buffer, 0, bytesRead);
            totalRead += bytesRead;
        }
        return out.toByteArray();
    }

    public static List<String> readLines(String s) {
        return Stream.of(s.split("\r?\n"))
                     .collect(Collectors.toList());
    }

    public static String readLine(Reader in, int sizeHint) throws IOException {
        StringBuilder sb = new StringBuilder(sizeHint > 0 ? sizeHint : 1024);
        int readChar;
        while ((readChar = in.read()) != -1) {
            char c = (char) readChar;
            sb.append(c);
            if (c == '\n') {
                break;
            }
        }
        return sb.toString();
    }

    // ... [Other methods remain unchanged] ...
}
```

### Summary of Changes
- **`readFully(File path, int max)`:** Refactored to avoid code duplication and better manage buffer sizes.
- **`readStreamFully`:** New helper method for reading an input stream fully, used by `readFully`.
- **`readLines`:** Simplified using Java Streams and regex for splitting lines.
- **`readLine`:** Optimized buffer management for better performance.

These changes are suggestions and should be tested thoroughly to ensure they align with the original intent of the methods and maintain compatibility with existing usages.
