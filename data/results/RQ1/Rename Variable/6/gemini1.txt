## Refactoring Opportunities

The provided code snippet contains several opportunities for refactoring:

1. **Reduce code duplication:** There is significant code duplication in the methods `testNumBackendCalls`, `testSeekAndReadWithConf`, and potentially other methods. This can be refactored by creating a helper method to encapsulate the common logic of opening the file, seeking to the specified position, reading data, and verifying the results.

2. **Extract magic numbers:** The constants `TEN`, `TWENTY`, and `ONE_KB` are used throughout the code. These can be extracted into meaningful variable names or constants to improve code readability.

3. **Simplify variable names:** Some variable names, like `iStream` and `buffer`, could be more descriptive to improve code clarity. Consider using names that reflect their specific purpose within the code.

4. **Use descriptive method names:** Method names like `testNumBackendCalls` and `seekReadAndTest` are not very descriptive. Refactoring these names to better reflect their functionality would improve code readability.


Here's an example of refactoring the `testNumBackendCalls` method using a helper method and more descriptive variable names:

```java
private static void testNumBackendCalls(boolean optimizeFooterRead, int fileSize) throws Exception {
  for (int footerReadBufferSize = 256; footerReadBufferSize <= 1024; footerReadBufferSize *= 2) {
    final AzureBlobFileSystem fs = getFileSystem(optimizeFooterRead, fileSize);
    verifyBackendCalls(fs, optimizeFooterRead, fileSize, footerReadBufferSize);
  }
}

private static void verifyBackendCalls(AzureBlobFileSystem fs, boolean optimizeFooterRead, int fileSize, int footerReadBufferSize) throws Exception {
  int fileIdx = 0;
  for (int i = 0; i <= 4; i++) {
    Path testFilePath = createPathAndFileWithContent(fs, fileIdx++, fileSize);
    FutureDataInputStreamBuilder builder = getParameterizedBuilder(testFilePath, fs, footerReadBufferSize);
    try (FSDataInputStream iStream = builder.build().get()) {
      // Seek and read logic here
      // ...
    }
  }
}
```

This refactoring improves code readability and maintainability by reducing duplication and using more descriptive names. You can apply similar techniques to other parts of the codebase.

It's important to note that these are just suggestions, and the specific refactoring approach may vary depending on your coding style and preferences.
