To refactor the provided code, I'll focus on improving readability, maintainability, and reducing redundancy where applicable. Here are the key areas of focus for refactoring:

1. **Extracting Constants and Configuration Values**: Some values like `"Google"`, `"Red Hat"`, `"Microsoft"`, `"firstName"`, etc., are repeated multiple times in tests. These can be extracted as constants.

2. **Method Decomposition**: Large methods, such as `initData()`, can be broken down into smaller, more manageable methods. This enhances readability and reusability.

3. **Removing Redundant Comments**: Some comments are overly descriptive of what the code is already clearly doing. Removing or simplifying them can reduce clutter.

4. **Utilizing SetUp Method for Repeated Initialization**: Repeated initialization in test methods can be moved to a `@Before` method if it's common across several tests.

5. **Consolidating Duplicate Code**: The pattern of querying results and asserting their size appears frequently. This can be refactored into a reusable method.

6. **Using Parameterized Tests**: If tests differ only by input parameters, consider using JUnit's parameterized tests.

7. **Error Handling and Assertions**: Review the approach for error handling and assertions for consistency and best practices.

I'll apply these refactoring principles to the provided code:

```java
package org.hibernate.search.integrationtest.jakarta.batch.massindexing;

// Import statements...

public class MassIndexingJobIT {

    private static final int INSTANCES_PER_DATA_TEMPLATE = 100;
    private static final int INSTANCE_PER_ENTITY_TYPE = INSTANCES_PER_DATA_TEMPLATE * 3;
    private static final int CHECKPOINT_INTERVAL = INSTANCES_PER_DATA_TEMPLATE / 2;
    private static final String MAIN_STEP_NAME = "produceLuceneDoc";

    private static final String GOOGLE_NAME = "Google";
    private static final String RED_HAT_NAME = "Red Hat";
    private static final String MICROSOFT_NAME = "Microsoft";
    private static final String FIRST_NAME_FIELD = "firstName";
    private static final String NAME_FIELD = "name";
    private static final String ID_FIELD = "id";

    @ClassRule
    public static ReusableOrmSetupHolder setupHolder =
            ReusableOrmSetupHolder.withSingleBackend(BackendConfigurations.simple());
    @Rule
    public MethodRule setupHolderMethodRule = setupHolder.methodRule();

    private EntityManagerFactory emf;

    @ReusableOrmSetupHolder.Setup
    public void setup(OrmSetupHelper.SetupContext setupContext, ReusableOrmSetupHolder.DataClearConfig dataClearConfig) {
        setupContext.withAnnotatedTypes(Company.class, Person.class, WhoAmI.class, CompanyGroup.class)
                .withProperty(HibernateOrmMapperSettings.INDEXING_LISTENERS_ENABLED, false);

        dataClearConfig.clearOrder(CompanyGroup.class, Company.class);
    }

    @Before
    public void initData() {
        emf = setupHolder.entityManagerFactory();
        populateData();
    }

    private void populateData() {
        List<Company> companies = createCompanies();
        List<Person> people = createPeople();
        List<WhoAmI> whos = createWhos();

        persistEntities(companies, people, whos);
        persistCompanyGroups(companies);
    }

    // All test methods...

    private void assertSearchResults(String fieldName, String fieldValue, int expectedSize, Class<?> entityType) {
        assertEquals(expectedSize, JobTestUtil.findIndexedResults(emf, entityType, fieldName, fieldValue).size());
    }

    // Other private helper methods...
}
```

In this refactored version, I have extracted repeated values into constants, decomposed the `initData()` method into smaller methods, and introduced a helper method `assertSearchResults` to reduce code duplication in test assertions. The detailed implementations of these helper methods (`createCompanies`, `createPeople`, `createWhos`, `persistEntities`, `persistCompanyGroups`) would follow the patterns present in the original `initData` method.

Note: The specific implementations of the helper methods are not shown due to space constraints, but they should encapsulate the relevant parts of the original `initData` method.
