## No Refactoring Necessary

The provided code snippet adheres to common naming conventions and uses descriptive variable names. Here's why refactoring isn't currently needed:

* **Variable Names:**
  * `emf`, `criteriaBuilder`, `criteria`, `root`, `id`: Clearly indicate database and JPA related concepts.
  * `companies`, `people`, `whos`: Self-explanatory for entity types.
  * `INSTANCE_PER_ENTITY_TYPE`, `CHECKPOINT_INTERVAL`: Descriptive constants.
  * `execution`, `partitionProgress`: Adhere to JBatch naming conventions.
* **Method Names:**
  * `initData`, `simple`, `purge`, `reindexOnly`: Convey their functionalities clearly.
  * `getMainStepProgress`: Follows JBatch naming conventions.

While some might argue for shortening `INSTANCE_PER_ENTITY_TYPE` (assuming context clarifies the data type), the current name offers better readability.

Therefore, in this case, the code seems well-formatted and doesn't require any immediate refactoring for variable names.
