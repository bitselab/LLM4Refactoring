In this code snippet, there are no clear opportunities for rename variable refactoring.  

The variable names are already descriptive and follow common naming conventions (e.g., `lhs`, `rhs`, `diffs`). While some might argue for renaming `booleanField` to something more specific based on its usage in `SimpleClass`, the current name accurately reflects its data type and purpose within that class.

Therefore, in this case, no refactoring is necessary.
