There are a few opportunities for rename variable refactoring in the provided code snippet:

1. **className**: This variable clearly describes its purpose. However, since it's consistently used with `Class` related concepts, a more specific name like `selectedClassName` could improve readability.

Here's the refactored code with the suggested change:

```java
package org.junit.platform.engine.discovery;

// ... (other imports)

public class ClassSelector implements DiscoverySelector {

  private final String selectedClassName; // renamed from className
  private final ClassLoader classLoader;

  private Class<?> javaClass;

  // ... (remaining constructors and methods)

}
```

2. **classLoader**: Similar to `className`, `classLoader` is clear but could be more specific considering its context. A name like `selectedClassLoader` might be more appropriate.

Here's the code with the additional rename:

```java
package org.junit.platform.engine.discovery;

// ... (other imports)

public class ClassSelector implements DiscoverySelector {

  private final String selectedClassName;
  private final ClassLoader selectedClassLoader; // renamed from classLoader

  private Class<?> javaClass;

  // ... (remaining constructors and methods)

}
```

These are the suggested refactorings. The original code functioned well with the original variable names. However, the changes improve readability by making the variable purpose even clearer in the context of the `ClassSelector` class.
