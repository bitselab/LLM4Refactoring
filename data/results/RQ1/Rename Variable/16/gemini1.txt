 **Here's a list of potential refactoring opportunities in the provided code snippet, along with explanations for each:**

**1. Simplify capacity calculation:**

- - Consolidate the nested `if` statements in `calculateCapacity` into a single expression using the conditional operator (`?:`).
- - Consider using a more concise formula for calculating the new capacity, potentially based on logarithmic growth to reduce reallocations.

**2. Streamline buffer handling:**

- - In `write(ByteBuffer... buffers)`, create a single combined buffer using `ByteBuffer.allocate(totalCapacity)` instead of multiple individual allocations for better performance.
- - Explore using `ByteBuffer.wrap(byte[])` directly in `write(byte[] source)` to avoid unnecessary intermediate `ByteBuffer` creation.

**3. Refactor duplicate logic:**

- - The methods `asByteBuffer` and `toByteBuffer` share similar logic. Combine their common parts into a private helper method to reduce code duplication.
- - Similarly, the `checkIndex` method could be refactored into a private utility method for use in multiple places.

**4. Improve readability:**

- - Break down complex conditional expressions into simpler boolean variables with descriptive names to enhance code clarity.
- - Add more meaningful comments to explain the purpose of variables and code blocks, especially for those with non-obvious logic.
- - Organize code into logical sections with clear headings to guide the reader through the code structure.

**5. Utilize Java 8 features:**

- - Employ lambda expressions and stream processing for concise and expressive code in operations like `Arrays.stream(buffers).mapToInt(ByteBuffer::remaining).sum()`.

**Additional suggestions based on best practices:**

- - Consider using a builder pattern to simplify object creation and configuration of `DefaultDataBuffer`.
- - Adhere to consistent naming conventions for methods and variables, following common Java code style guidelines.
- - Thoroughly unit test the code after refactoring to ensure that any changes haven't introduced errors or affected functionality.
