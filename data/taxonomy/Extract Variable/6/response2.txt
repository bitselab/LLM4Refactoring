In the provided code snippet, there is an opportunity to apply the extract variable refactoring pattern to improve readability and possibly performance by reducing repetitive method calls. The method `getAbfsStore(fs).getAbfsConfiguration()` is called multiple times, which is a good candidate for extraction.

Here's the refactored version of the code:

```java
private AzureBlobFileSystem getFileSystem(final boolean optimizeFooterRead,
                                          final int fileSize) throws IOException {
    final AzureBlobFileSystem fs = getFileSystem();
    // Extract repeated expression
    final AbfsConfiguration config = getAbfsStore(fs).getAbfsConfiguration();
    
    config.setOptimizeFooterRead(optimizeFooterRead);
    if (fileSize <= config.getReadBufferSize()) {
        config.setReadSmallFilesCompletely(false);
    }
    return fs;
}
```

### Changes Made:
1. **Extracted the expression** `getAbfsStore(fs).getAbfsConfiguration()` into a new variable `config`.
2. Used this new variable `config` to replace all occurrences of `getAbfsStore(fs).getAbfsConfiguration()` in the subsequent method calls within the function.

This refactoring simplifies the code by reducing the duplication of method calls and makes the method's operations clearer by centralizing the configuration operations on a single object reference. It also reduces the potential overhead of repeatedly accessing the configuration object through a chain of method calls.
