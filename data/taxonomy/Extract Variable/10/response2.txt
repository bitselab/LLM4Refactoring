In the provided code snippet, there are multiple opportunities for applying the extract variable refactoring to enhance readability and reduce redundancy. The expression `type.asWildcard()` is repeated multiple times, which makes it a candidate for extraction. Additionally, other repeated method calls can be extracted into variables to simplify conditional checks and assignments.

Here's the refactored code:

```java
default ResolvedType useThisTypeParametersOnTheGivenType(ResolvedType type) {
    if (type.isTypeVariable()) {
        ResolvedTypeParameterDeclaration typeParameter = type.asTypeParameter();
        if (typeParameter.declaredOnType()) {
            Optional<ResolvedType> typeParam = typeParamValue(typeParameter);
            if (typeParam.isPresent()) {
                ResolvedType typeParamResolved = typeParam.get();
                // Extracted the typeParam.get() method call to reduce redundancy
                if (typeParamResolved.isWildcard()) {
                    ResolvedWildcard wildcardType = typeParamResolved.asWildcard();  // Extracted asWildcard call
                    // Try to avoid an infinite loop when the type is a wildcard type bounded by a type variable like "? super T"
                    if (!wildcardType.equals(ResolvedWildcard.UNBOUNDED) && type.equals(wildcardType.getBoundedType())) {
                        return type;
                    }
                }
                type = typeParamResolved;
            }
        }
    }
    if (type.isWildcard()) {
        ResolvedWildcard wildcardType = type.asWildcard();  // Extracted asWildcard call
        if (wildcardType.isBounded()) {
            if (wildcardType.isExtends()) {
                return ResolvedWildcard.extendsBound(useThisTypeParametersOnTheGivenType(wildcardType.getBoundedType()));
            }
            return ResolvedWildcard.superBound(useThisTypeParametersOnTheGivenType(wildcardType.getBoundedType()));
        }
    }
    if (type.isReferenceType()) {
        type = type.asReferenceType().transformTypeParameters(this::useThisTypeParametersOnTheGivenType);
    }
    return type;
}
```

In this refactoring:

1. I extracted `typeParam.get()` into `typeParamResolved` because it is used multiple times for various checks and assignments.
2. The `type.asWildcard()` call, used in several conditions and method calls, is also extracted to a variable `wildcardType` to simplify the expression and improve clarity.

These changes make the code cleaner and reduce the complexity of method calls, improving maintainability and readability.
