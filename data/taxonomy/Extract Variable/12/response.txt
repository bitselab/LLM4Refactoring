The provided code snippet from the `CommitGraphWriter` class is well-structured, with significant use of constants and appropriate segmentation into methods. However, there are a few opportunities for extract variable refactorings to enhance readability and reduce redundancy.

### Refactoring Opportunities:
1. **Repeated Access to Constants**:
   - In several methods, constants like `hashsz`, `CHUNK_ID_OID_FANOUT`, etc., are accessed multiple times. Extracting these into local variables at the beginning of methods could improve clarity.

2. **Magic Numbers**:
   - There are instances of magic numbers, like buffer sizes and offsets (e.g., `byte[4]`, `byte[8]`). While not directly related to repeated expressions, introducing named constants or variables for these could improve maintainability and readability.

Here's the refactored version of a few methods demonstrating these changes:

### Refactored Code:
```java
package org.eclipse.jgit.internal.storage.commitgraph;

// Imports remain unchanged

public class CommitGraphWriter {
    // Class fields and other methods remain unchanged

    private void writeHeader(CancellableDigestOutputStream out, int numChunks)
            throws IOException {
        int headerLength = 8;
        byte[] headerBuffer = new byte[headerLength];
        NB.encodeInt32(headerBuffer, 0, COMMIT_GRAPH_MAGIC);
        byte[] buff = {
            (byte) COMMIT_GRAPH_VERSION_GENERATED,
            (byte) OID_HASH_VERSION,
            (byte) numChunks,
            (byte) 0
        };
        System.arraycopy(buff, 0, headerBuffer, 4, 4);
        out.write(headerBuffer, 0, headerLength);
        out.flush();
    }

    private void writeChunkLookup(CancellableDigestOutputStream out,
                                  List<ChunkHeader> chunks) throws IOException {
        int numChunks = chunks.size();
        long chunkOffset = 8 + (numChunks + 1L) * CHUNK_LOOKUP_WIDTH;
        byte[] buffer = new byte[CHUNK_LOOKUP_WIDTH];
        for (ChunkHeader chunk : chunks) {
            NB.encodeInt32(buffer, 0, chunk.id);
            NB.encodeInt64(buffer, 4, chunkOffset);
            out.write(buffer);
            chunkOffset += chunk.size;
        }
        NB.encodeInt32(buffer, 0, 0);
        NB.encodeInt64(buffer, 4, chunkOffset);
        out.write(buffer);
    }

    private void writeChunks(CancellableDigestOutputStream out,
                             List<ChunkHeader> chunks) throws IOException {
        for (ChunkHeader chunk : chunks) {
            switch (chunk.id) {
                case CHUNK_ID_OID_FANOUT:
                    writeFanoutTable(out);
                    break;
                case CHUNK_ID_OID_LOOKUP:
                    writeOidLookUp(out);
                    break;
                case CHUNK_ID_COMMIT_DATA:
                    writeCommitData(out);
                    break;
                case CHUNK_ID_EXTRA_EDGE_LIST:
                    writeExtraEdges(out);
                    break;
                case CHUNK_ID_BLOOM_FILTER_INDEX:
                case CHUNK_ID_BLOOM_FILTER_DATA:
                    if (!chunk.data.isPresent()) {
                        throw new IllegalStateException(
                                "Data for this chunk must be precomputed");
                    }
                    chunk.data.get().writeTo(out);
                    break;
                default:
                    throw new IllegalStateException(
                            "Don't know how to write chunk " + chunk.id);
            }
        }
    }

    // Other methods remain unchanged
}
```

### Explanation:
- In `writeHeader`, a local variable `headerLength` was introduced to replace the repeated magic number `8`.
- In `writeChunkLookup`, the repeated `CHUNK_LOOKUP_WIDTH` and size calculations for the `buffer` have been kept as they enhance readability without introducing a new variable.
- In the `writeChunks` method, the handling of chunks remains unchanged since the switch-case pattern efficiently handles the different types of chunks without unnecessary duplication.

This refactoring focuses on extracting commonly used values within methods, improving readability while avoiding over-engineering.
