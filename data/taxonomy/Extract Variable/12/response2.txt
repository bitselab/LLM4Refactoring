The provided code snippet for `writeCommitData` contains several opportunities for refactoring using the "Extract Variable" pattern. This refactoring will aim to simplify the code by reducing duplication and improving readability. Here’s a detailed refactoring:

1. **Repeated Method Calls:** There are multiple calls to `out.getWriteMonitor()` that can be extracted to a variable. This will minimize method call overhead and improve code readability.
2. **Repeated Array Accesses:** The manipulation of `tmp` array, especially at indexes `hashsz`, `hashsz + 4`, `hashsz + 8`, and `hashsz + 12` is repetitive and can be made more readable by introducing variables that hold these indices.
3. **Repeatedly Computing Edge Values:** The way `edgeValue` is calculated based on the number of parents can be simplified by extracting the conditions into a separate method or more descriptive variables.

Here’s the refactored code:

```java
private void writeCommitData(CancellableDigestOutputStream out)
        throws IOException {
    int[] generations = computeGenerationNumbers(out.getWriteMonitor());
    WriteMonitor writeMonitor = out.getWriteMonitor();
    writeMonitor.beginTask(JGitText.get().writingOutCommitGraph, graphCommits.size());
    
    int num = 0;
    byte[] tmp = new byte[hashsz + COMMIT_DATA_WIDTH];
    int i = 0;
    
    for (RevCommit commit : graphCommits) {
        int edgeValue;
        int[] packedDate = new int[2];

        ObjectId treeId = commit.getTree();
        treeId.copyRawTo(tmp, 0);

        RevCommit[] parents = commit.getParents();
        edgeValue = computeEdgeValue(parents, num);

        int edgeIndex = hashsz;
        NB.encodeInt32(tmp, edgeIndex, edgeValue);

        if (parents.length > 2) {
            num += parents.length - 1;
        }

        int packedDateIndex = hashsz + 8;
        packedDate[0] = 0; // commitTime is an int in JGit now
        packedDate[0] |= generations[i] << 2;
        packedDate[1] = commit.getCommitTime();
        NB.encodeInt32(tmp, packedDateIndex, packedDate[0]);
        NB.encodeInt32(tmp, packedDateIndex + 4, packedDate[1]);

        out.write(tmp);
        writeMonitor.update(1);
        i++;
    }
    writeMonitor.endTask();
}

private int computeEdgeValue(RevCommit[] parents, int num) {
    if (parents.length == 0) {
        return GRAPH_NO_PARENT;
    } else if (parents.length == 1) {
        return GRAPH_NO_PARENT;
    } else if (parents.length == 2) {
        return graphCommits.getOidPosition(parents[1]);
    } else {
        return GRAPH_EXTRA_EDGES_NEEDED | num;
    }
}
```

**Changes made:**
- **`writeMonitor` variable**: This refactoring extracts the repeated calls to `out.getWriteMonitor()` into a single variable, reducing duplication.
- **`computeEdgeValue` method**: This separates the logic of computing `edgeValue` based on `parents` into its own method, making the loop more readable and modular.
- **Index Variables**: While the index variables for `tmp` are not explicitly named, comments or further variables could be added to indicate purpose, especially if `hashsz` changes or the structure of `tmp` is adjusted in future.

These changes aim to improve the maintainability and clarity of the code.
