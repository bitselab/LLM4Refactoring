In the provided code snippet, an opportunity for the extract variable refactoring pattern can be identified for the repeated method call `exchange.getRequest()`. By extracting this expression into a variable, the code readability can be improved, making it easier to follow the logic and ensuring consistency in accessing the same object. This refactoring also ensures that if the implementation of `getRequest()` changes in the future, the refactoring point would be centralized to this new variable.

Here's the refactored version of the code:

```java
public boolean associate(HttpExchange exchange)
{
    boolean result = false;
    boolean abort = true;
    HttpRequest request = exchange.getRequest(); // Extracted variable
    try (AutoLock ignored = _lock.lock())
    {
        if (_exchange == null)
        {
            abort = false;
            result = exchange.associate(this);
            if (result)
                _exchange = exchange;
        }
    }

    if (abort)
    {
        request.abort(new UnsupportedOperationException("Pipelined requests not supported"));
    }
    else
    {
        request.setConnection(getConnection());
        if (LOG.isDebugEnabled())
            LOG.debug("{} associated {} to {}", exchange, result, this);
    }

    return result;
}
```

In this version, `exchange.getRequest()` is called once and stored in the `request` variable. This variable is then used wherever `exchange.getRequest()` was originally called, thus adhering to the extract variable refactoring pattern to remove repeated expressions and improve code readability.
