In the provided code snippet, an extract variable refactoring can be applied to improve clarity and avoid repetition. The repeated expression `this.prefix + this.invokedMethod` is used twice, making it a good candidate for extraction to a new variable.

Here's the refactored code:

```java
private void recordInvocation(String methodName) {
    if (this.invokedMethod != null) {
        throw new IllegalStateException("Already closed via " + this.invokedMethod);
    }
    this.invokedMethod = methodName;
    String fullMethod = this.prefix + this.invokedMethod;  // Extracted variable
    recorder.add(fullMethod);
    if (this.fail) {
        throw new RuntimeException(fullMethod);
    }
}
```

In this refactoring:
- I introduced a new variable `fullMethod` to hold the value of `this.prefix + this.invokedMethod`.
- This change reduces the need to concatenate the strings multiple times, potentially improving performance slightly and definitely improving the readability of the code.
