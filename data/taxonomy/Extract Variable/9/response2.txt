The given code snippet can benefit from an extract variable refactoring, particularly to avoid repeated method calls and improve readability. In this case, the method `getPathFromClass(klass)` is called multiple times. Extracting this expression into a variable could make the code cleaner and potentially more efficient, as it reduces the number of method invocations.

Here's the refactored code:

```java
private static Path getSomeRoot(Class<?> klass) {
    // Under jps-bootstrap home is already known, reuse it
    String communityHome = System.getenv(JPS_BOOTSTRAP_COMMUNITY_HOME_ENV_NAME);
    if (communityHome != null) {
        return Path.of(communityHome).normalize();
    }

    Path classPath = getPathFromClass(klass);
    if (!classPath.toString().endsWith("class")) {
        throw new IllegalArgumentException(
                String.format("To guess idea home, you must provide class that resides in .class file inside of idea home dir. " +
                        "But provided %s resides in %s", klass, classPath));
    }
    return classPath;
}
```

By extracting `getPathFromClass(klass)` into a variable `classPath`, the code avoids the repeated method call, enhancing the maintainability and possibly improving performance if the method call is non-trivial. This refactoring aligns with the pattern of reducing redundancy and improving code clarity.
