Extract variable refactorings are frequently employed to remove repeated expressions to improve readability and reusability.
##################################################
An extract variable refactoring pattern is to extract repeated expressions as a new variable within the same method. Here is an example of the extract variable refactoring that follows this pattern.
The source code before refactoring is:
```
private Map<String, User> getIssueUsersByLogin(Issue issue) {
    Map<String, User> usersByLogin = Maps.newHashMap();
    if (issue.assignee() != null) {
        usersByLogin.put(issue.assignee(), userIndex.getByLogin(issue.assignee()));
    }
    String reporter = issue.reporter();
    if (reporter != null) {
        usersByLogin.put(reporter, userIndex.getByLogin(reporter));
    }
    return usersByLogin;
}
```
The source code after refactoring is:
```
private Map<String, User> getIssueUsersByLogin(Issue issue) {
    Map<String, User> usersByLogin = Maps.newHashMap();
    String assignee = issue.assignee();
    if (assignee != null) {
        usersByLogin.put(assignee, userIndex.getByLogin(assignee));
    }
    String reporter = issue.reporter();
    if (reporter != null) {
        usersByLogin.put(reporter, userIndex.getByLogin(reporter));
    }
    return usersByLogin;
}
```
In this example, the developer extracted the expression "issue.assignee()" as new variable "assignee".

As a developer, imagine your team leader requests you to review a piece of code to identify potential extract variable refactoring opportunities that follows the refactoring pattern above. The original code snippet is as follows:
```
private <T> RuntimeException prettifyFailure(
        MockCreationSettings<T> mockFeatures, Exception generationFailed) {
    if (mockFeatures.getTypeToMock().isArray()) {
        throw new MockitoException(
                join("Arrays cannot be mocked: " + mockFeatures.getTypeToMock() + ".", ""), generationFailed);
    }
    if (Modifier.isFinal(mockFeatures.getTypeToMock().getModifiers())) {
        throw new MockitoException(
                join(
                        "Mockito cannot mock this class: " + mockFeatures.getTypeToMock() + ".",
                        "Can not mock final classes with the following settings :",
                        " - explicit serialization (e.g. withSettings().serializable())",
                        " - extra interfaces (e.g. withSettings().extraInterfaces(...))",
                        "",

                        "You can still return an existing enum literal from a stubbed method call."),
                generationFailed);

                        "Most likely it is a private class that is not visible by Mockito",
                        "",
                        "You are seeing this disclaimer because Mockito is configured to create inlined mocks.",

                    "",

                            "IBM J9 VM",
                            "Early IBM virtual machine are known to have issues with Mockito, please upgrade to an up-to-date version.\n",

If there are any refactoring opportunities, please do it and generate the refactored code. Otherwise, simply state that no refactoring is necessary.
