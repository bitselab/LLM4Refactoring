Inline method refactorings are frequently employed to eliminate unnecessary methods to improve readability.
##################################################
An inline method refactoring pattern is to remove methods with only a few statements. Here is an example of the inline method refactoring that follows this pattern.
The source code before refactoring is:
```
private final class OpenSslSession implements SSLSession, ApplicationProtocolAccessor {

    public Principal getLocalPrincipal() {
        Certificate[] local = getLocalCertificates();
        if (local == null || local.length == 0) {
            return null;
        }
        return principal(local);
    }

    private Principal principal(Certificate[] certs) {
        return ((java.security.cert.X509Certificate) certs[0]).getIssuerX500Principal();
    }

}
```
The source code after refactoring is:
```
private final class OpenSslSession implements SSLSession, ApplicationProtocolAccessor {

    public Principal getLocalPrincipal() {
        Certificate[] local = getLocalCertificates();
        if (local == null || local.length == 0) {
            return null;
        }
        return ((java.security.cert.X509Certificate) local[0]).getIssuerX500Principal();
    }

}
```
In this example, the developer removed the unnecessary method "principal".

As a developer, imagine your team leader requests you to review a piece of code to identify potential inline method refactoring opportunities that follows the refactoring pattern above. The original code snippet is as follows:
```
public class AbstractLangTest {

    /**
     * All tests should leave the {@link ToStringStyle} registry empty.
     */
    @AfterEach
    public void after() {
        validateNullToStringStyleRegistry();
    }

    void validateNullToStringStyleRegistry() {
        assertNull(ToStringStyle.getRegistry(), "Expected null, actual: " + ToStringStyle.getRegistry());
    }

}
```
If there are any refactoring opportunities, please do it and generate the refactored code. Otherwise, simply state that no refactoring is necessary.
