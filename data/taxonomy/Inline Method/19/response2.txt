In the provided code snippet for the class `WebServerSslBundle`, there is an opportunity for inline method refactoring similar to the pattern described previously. Here's an assessment of the scenario:

The `get(Ssl ssl, SslBundles sslBundles)` method is a proxy method that simply calls the more detailed `get(Ssl ssl, SslBundles sslBundles, SslStoreProvider sslStoreProvider)` method with `null` as the third parameter. This pattern matches the one where a method that merely forwards parameters to another method can be inlined if it doesn't add significant clarity or utility.

Here is the refactored code with the inline method refactoring applied:
```java
public final class WebServerSslBundle implements SslBundle {

    @Deprecated(since = "3.1.0", forRemoval = true)
    @SuppressWarnings("removal")
    public static SslBundle get(Ssl ssl, SslBundles sslBundles) throws NoSuchSslBundleException {
        Assert.state(Ssl.isEnabled(ssl), "SSL is not enabled");
        String keyPassword = ssl.getKeyPassword();
        String bundleName = ssl.getBundle();
        if (StringUtils.hasText(bundleName)) {
            Assert.state(sslBundles != null,
                    () -> "SSL bundle '%s' was requested but no SslBundles instance was provided"
                            .formatted(bundleName));
            return sslBundles.getBundle(bundleName);
        }
        SslStoreBundle stores = createStoreBundle(ssl);
        return new WebServerSslBundle(stores, keyPassword, ssl);
    }

}
```
In this refactored code:
- The overloaded `get(Ssl ssl, SslBundles sslBundles, SslStoreProvider sslStoreProvider)` method is removed, consolidating its functionality into `get(Ssl ssl, SslBundles sslBundles)`.
- Since the original overloaded method was marked as deprecated and for removal, consolidating it simplifies the class interface and aligns with the deprecation plan, potentially eliminating a source of confusion or error in future development.
