In the provided `DefaultArgumentConverter` class, the primary functionality revolves around converting different types of inputs, especially strings, to a variety of Java types. The class employs several private nested classes (`StringToObjectConverter` implementations) to handle specific conversion logic, and uses a `convertToTargetType` method to delegate to these converters based on the target type.

Upon reviewing the structure and the call patterns of the methods within the class, the current setup does not exhibit typical patterns where inline method refactoring would be beneficial. Each method and inner class serves a distinct purpose, contributing to the modularity and maintainability of the code. Here's a brief analysis:

1. **Nested `StringToObjectConverter` implementations**: These classes each encapsulate conversion logic for specific types, such as `StringToBooleanConverter`, `StringToNumberConverter`, etc. These converters are utilized within the `convertToTargetType` method and are structured to allow for easy extension or modification without affecting other parts of the code.

2. **`convert` and `convertToTargetType` Methods**: The `convert` method serves as an entry point that handles null checks and type assignments before calling `convertToTargetType`. This latter method performs the actual conversion by selecting the appropriate converter from the `stringToObjectConverters` list. Inline these methods would mean moving considerable logic into a single method, likely making it less clear and more difficult to manage.

3. **Utility and Helper Methods**: The methods like `toWrapperType` are utility functions that are called in multiple places, making them unsuitable for inlining without duplicating code.

Based on this structure, there are no clear candidates for inline method refactoring that would simplify or enhance the code without reducing clarity or modularity. The current design appears to be well-suited for the responsibilities of the `DefaultArgumentConverter` class, emphasizing clean separation of concerns and ease of future changes. Thus, no refactoring is necessary in this case.
