After reviewing the provided code snippet from `CacheAspectSupport`, the class is designed to handle various cache-related operations in a complex environment. The methods and inner classes are well-organized, each with specific responsibilities essential for the overall caching mechanism, including handling cache operations, generating keys, resolving cache conflicts, and integrating with reactive programming patterns.

### Analysis for Inline Method Refactoring:
1. **Complexity and Interdependencies**: The methods in this class are quite interconnected, where each method plays a unique role in handling the caching mechanism. Inline method refactoring usually targets methods that are overly simplistic and do not contribute to the readability or modularity of the code. In this case, most methods are justifiably complex and modular.

2. **Usage of Helper Methods**: The helper methods such as `getCacheOperationMetadata`, `generateKey`, `getBean`, and similar are crucial for keeping the code modular, maintainable, and readable. They abstract various parts of the caching logic that are repetitive or complex.

3. **Potential for Inline Refactoring**: The current methods do not show obvious candidates for inline refactoring without risking the clarity and maintenance of the code. Each method either:
   - Handles a specific aspect of cache management, or
   - Abstracts complex logic that, if inlined, would make the main methods overly complex and harder to maintain.

### Conclusion:
**No inline method refactoring is necessary** for this particular class (`CacheAspectSupport`). Each method contributes to the overall architecture and readability of the class by encapsulating specific functionalities. Inline refactoring could potentially reduce the modularity and clarity of the code, which is crucial for a component that handles multiple aspects of caching in a Spring application.
