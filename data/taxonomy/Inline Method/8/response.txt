Reviewing the provided code snippet for inline method refactoring opportunities, the goal is to find and possibly eliminate methods that perform trivial or straightforward tasks that can be absorbed into their caller method, improving readability and perhaps even performance by reducing the overhead of a method call.

### Analysis of the Current Code

1. **RootFailureCollector class**:
   - `checkNoFailure()`: This method is fairly complex and seems justified as a separate method due to its error handling and use of multiple local methods and objects.
   - `withContext(EventContext context)` and `withContext(EventContextElement contextElement)`: These delegate methods in `RootFailureCollector` simply pass their arguments to the `delegate` object. While they are technically candidates for inline refactoring, this would require changing all the callers to directly use `delegate.withContext(...)`. Given their role in enforcing encapsulation and possibly future extensibility, it may be advisable to retain them as they are.

2. **NonRootFailureCollector class**:
   - `withContext(EventContext context)` and `withContext(EventContextElement contextElement)`: These methods perform significant operations involving logic that handles context changes, making them unsuitable for inlining.
   - `appendContextTo(StringJoiner joiner)`: This method does nothing in `NonRootFailureCollector` and is overridden in `ContextualFailureCollectorImpl`. It represents an example of a method that could be a target for inlining if not for its overriding implementations which indicate its utility in polymorphism.

3. **ContextualFailureCollectorImpl class**:
   - `withDefaultContext()`: This method returns `this`, which is straightforward, but it is overridden to alter behavior for base and derived classes, thus inlining this would remove the flexibility offered by the override.
   - `appendContextTo(StringJoiner joiner)`: This method again extends functionality in derived classes, making it unsuitable for inlining without losing clarity or functionality.

### Conclusion

After analyzing the various methods in the provided code snippet, **no suitable candidates for inline method refactoring** are apparent without potentially compromising the design or maintainability of the system. The methods that do simple delegations or very trivial actions are structured as such likely for good reasons related to object-oriented design principles such as encapsulation and polymorphism. Therefore, I would recommend retaining the current structure without inlining any methods.
