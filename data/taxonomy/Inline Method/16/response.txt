The provided code for the `SolrXmlConfig` class in Apache Solr is complex, managing multiple aspects of Solr configuration from XML parsing to system property handling. Inline method refactoring, in this context, aims to remove methods that primarily serve as wrappers or simple pass-throughs, to simplify the code and improve readability.

Here's a review of the code for potential inline method refactoring opportunities following the example you provided:

### Analysis of the Code

- **Method `wrapAndSetZkHostFromSysPropIfNeeded`**:
  This method encapsulates logic for checking and setting the `zkHost` system property in a `Properties` object. Since it includes conditional logic and is used in multiple places, inlining this method would not simplify the code; instead, it would lead to code duplication.

- **Method `fromConfig`, `fromFile`, `fromInputStream`, and other factory methods**:
  These methods are essential for creating `NodeConfig` instances from different sources (like files, input streams, etc.). Each method handles distinct steps in the configuration process, which involve significant error handling and resource management. Inlining these would complicate the code's structure significantly, making it harder to maintain.

- **Method `fillSolrSection` and similar methods**:
  These methods involve complex logic for parsing and constructing configurations. They are structured to modularize the parsing logic based on different parts of the configuration. Inlining any of these methods would lead to a substantial increase in the complexity of the calling methods.

### Conclusion

The current structure of the methods in `SolrXmlConfig` appears to be designed to handle distinct aspects of the configuration loading and parsing processes effectively. Each method encapsulates specific functionality that, if inlined, would not necessarily improve readability or maintainability; rather, it would likely lead to code duplication and make individual methods overly complex and hard to manage.

**Recommendation**: No inline method refactoring is necessary for the provided `SolrXmlConfig` class as it would not add value in terms of simplifying the codebase or improving readability. The existing method breakdown serves well for modularity and clarity.
