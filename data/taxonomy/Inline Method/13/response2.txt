In the provided code snippet for the `StringToEnumConverter` class, there is a clear opportunity to apply inline method refactoring. The method `valueOf` consists of just one statement that directly delegates to `Enum.valueOf`. This minimal complexity makes it an ideal candidate for inline refactoring, as the single line of code can be easily integrated into the `convert` method without losing clarity. Here is the refactored version of the code:

```java
class StringToEnumConverter implements StringToObjectConverter {

    @Override
    public Object convert(String source, Class<?> targetType) throws Exception {
        return Enum.valueOf(targetType, source);
    }

}
```

In this refactored version, the `valueOf` method has been removed, and its functionality is directly incorporated into the `convert` method. This not only reduces the overall size of the code but also enhances readability by reducing the redirection between methods.
