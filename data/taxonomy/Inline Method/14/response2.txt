In the provided code snippet for `MSBRadixSorter`, there is an opportunity for inline method refactoring. The method `introSort` only delegates its functionality to another method, `sort`, from a returned sorter object obtained via `getFallbackSorter(k)`. This method can be inlined to simplify the code and reduce indirection, improving readability as per the pattern illustrated earlier.

Here is the refactored code:

```java
public abstract class MSBRadixSorter extends Sorter {

    protected void sort(int from, int to, int k, int l) {
        if (shouldFallback(from, to, l)) {
            getFallbackSorter(k).sort(from, to);
        } else {
            radixSort(from, to, k, l);
        }
    }

}
```

In this refactoring, the `introSort` method is removed, and its only statement is integrated directly into the conditional within the `sort` method. This aligns with the principle of reducing unnecessary methods to streamline the code.
