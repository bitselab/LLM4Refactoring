In the given `CommandLineBuilder` class, we observe a similar pattern to the previous example where inline method refactoring could be beneficial. The `toString()` method is essentially a proxy that only calls another method (`toString(String delim)`) with a fixed argument (`" "`). This pattern fits the criteria for inline method refactoring to eliminate unnecessary method layers and improve code readability and compactness.

Here is the refactored code for `CommandLineBuilder` class after applying the inline method refactoring:

```java
public class CommandLineBuilder
{

    @Override
    public String toString()
    {
        StringBuilder buf = new StringBuilder();
        for (String arg : args)
        {
            if (buf.length() > 0)
                buf.append(" "); // directly using the delimiter " "
            buf.append(arg); // we assume escaping has occurred during addArg
        }

        return buf.toString();
    }

}
```

This refactoring removes the `toString(String delim)` method, incorporating its logic directly into the `toString()` method. The hardcoded delimiter `" "` is used directly in the loop where string concatenation occurs. This change keeps the class functionality intact while removing an unnecessary method call, thereby simplifying the code structure.
