Reviewing the provided source code of the `AbstractApplicationContext` class in the Spring Framework context, it's evident that the class is a comprehensive implementation of various application context functionalities. This includes lifecycle management, bean factory post-processing, event multicasting, and more. The class is designed with extensibility and flexibility in mind, supporting a wide range of behaviors through the override of template methods and the use of delegation.

The methods in this class are integral to its function, often leveraging Spring's rich framework capabilities such as environment abstraction, bean lifecycle processing, and application event management. Most of the methods are interconnected and provide essential functionality that, if inline, would likely compromise the readability, maintainability, and separation of concerns that are critical in such a foundational component of the Spring Framework.

Given this context and the nature of the class:
- **No clear candidates for inline method refactoring** are evident. Each method tends to encapsulate a distinct piece of functionality that contributes to the overall behavior of the application context in a significant way. 

Inline method refactoring is typically applied to simplify the code where methods are overly granular and do not significantly contribute to clarity or abstraction. However, in this class:
- Methods are adequately granular with clear responsibilities.
- Inlining them would likely lead to large, complex methods that are harder to maintain and understand.
- The class also makes use of template methods that are intended to be overridden in subclasses, providing a flexible API that facilitates customization without altering the core logic.

Therefore, **no refactoring is necessary** for this class based on the inline method refactoring pattern. The current implementation adheres well to the principles of clean code and effective object-oriented design.
