The given code in `IntermediateResultPartition` class presents an opportunity for inline method refactoring. The `computeNumberOfSubpartitions()` method is only called once within the class and can be directly integrated into the `getNumberOfSubpartitions()` method. This will simplify the class by removing the unnecessary indirection of the private method, while also keeping the code straightforward and enhancing readability, aligning with the refactoring pattern you've described.

Here's how the refactored code would look:

```java
public class IntermediateResultPartition {

    public int getNumberOfSubpartitions() {
        if (!getProducer().getExecutionGraphAccessor().isDynamic()) {
            List<ConsumerVertexGroup> consumerVertexGroups = getConsumerVertexGroups();
            checkState(!consumerVertexGroups.isEmpty());

            // The produced data is partitioned among a number of subpartitions, one for each
            // consuming sub task. All vertex groups must have the same number of consumers
            // for non-dynamic graph.
            return consumerVertexGroups.get(0).size();
        } else {
            return numberOfSubpartitionsForDynamicGraph;
        }
    }

}
```

In this version:
- The private method `computeNumberOfSubpartitions()` has been eliminated.
- The logic of computing the number of subpartitions based on whether the execution graph is dynamic or not is directly incorporated into the `getNumberOfSubpartitions()` method. This maintains the original functionality while streamlining the class structure.
