The inline method refactoring pattern you provided is used to eliminate unnecessary methods that only serve as simple proxies or wrappers with minimal logic. To assess the inline refactoring opportunities in the provided code, let's analyze the methods to see if any are redundant or can be simplified by integrating their logic directly into the calling methods.

### Analysis of Methods

1. **writeByte(long dest, byte b) and writeByte(byte b)**: These methods have distinct functionalities; the first writes a byte at an absolute position while the second appends a byte to the current position. They cannot be inlined without losing clarity or altering functionality.

2. **writeBytes(byte[] b, int offset, int len) and writeBytes(long dest, byte[] b, int offset, int len)**: Similar to the previous point, these methods serve different purposesâ€”one writes at the current position and adjusts the position, and the other writes at a specified absolute position without changing the current write position. Their separation improves code readability and maintenance.

3. **copyBytes(DataInput input, long numBytes) and copyBytes(long src, long dest, int len)**: These methods are designed for different scenarios; the first copies bytes from an external `DataInput` into the byte store, and the second is an internal method for copying within the store. The functionality and use case differences justify their separate existence.

4. **getReverseReader(boolean allowSingle) and getReverseBytesReader()**: `getReverseBytesReader()` appears to be a simple wrapper that calls `getReverseReader(true)`. This is a potential candidate for inlining, but it depends on whether external calls rely on the simpler interface of `getReverseBytesReader()`.

5. **Various utility methods**: Methods like `writeInt(long pos, int value)`, `reverse(long srcPos, long destPos)`, and `skipBytes(int len)` provide specific functionalities that are used in different contexts within the class, suggesting that they should remain as separate methods for better modularity and readability.

### Conclusion

Most methods in the `BytesStore` class are well-designed for specific functionalities and maintain a good level of abstraction and separation of concerns. However, there could be an argument for inlining `getReverseBytesReader()` since it merely delegates to `getReverseReader(true)` without adding significant logic. Here's the potential refactoring for that:

#### Refactored Code Snippet

```java
@Override
public FST.BytesReader getReverseBytesReader() {
    if (blocks.size() == 1) {
        return new ReverseBytesReader(blocks.get(0));
    }
    return new FST.BytesReader() {
        private byte[] current = blocks.size() == 0 ? null : blocks.get(0);
        private int nextBuffer = -1;
        private int nextRead = 0;

        @Override
        public byte readByte() {
            if (nextRead == -1) {
                current = blocks.get(nextBuffer--);
                nextRead = blockSize - 1;
            }
            return current[nextRead--];
        }

        @Override
        public void skipBytes(long count) {
            setPosition(getPosition() - count);
        }

        @Override
        public void readBytes(byte[] b, int offset, int len) {
            for (int i = 0; i < len; i++) {
                b[offset + i] = readByte();
            }
        }

        @Override
        public long getPosition() {
            return ((long) nextBuffer + 1) * blockSize + nextRead;
        }

        @Override
        public void setPosition(long pos) {
            int bufferIndex = (int) (pos >> blockBits);
            if (nextBuffer != bufferIndex - 1) {
                nextBuffer = bufferIndex - 1;
                current = blocks.get(bufferIndex);
            }
            nextRead = (int) (pos & blockMask);
            assert getPosition() == pos : "pos=" + pos + " getPos()=" + getPosition();
        }

        @Override
        public boolean reversed() {
            return true;
        }
    };
}
```

In this refactored version, `getReverseBytesReader()` now directly contains the logic from `getReverseReader(true)`, eliminating the need for the latter method. This is a minimal change and the only clear candidate for inlining based on the provided pattern and current usage within the class.
