In the provided code snippet, there are two parameters: `testEvent` and `msg`. Both parameters are fairly clear in their intent, but there might be opportunities for renaming to improve clarity further, depending on the context or the team's naming conventions.

The parameter `testEvent` is accurate in describing that it handles an event in a test, but if it's meant to represent a collection or a sequence of events rather than a single event, a name like `events` might better convey this. 

The parameter `msg` is a common abbreviation for `message`, and while it is concise, expanding abbreviations can often enhance readability, particularly for those who might not be as familiar with common abbreviations in programming.

Here's a potential refactoring of the code:

```java
private static void assertFailingWithMessage(Events events, String message) {
    events//
            .assertStatistics(stats -> stats.failed(1))//
            .assertThatEvents().haveExactly(1, finishedWithFailure(message(message)));
}
```

In this refactor:
- `testEvent` is renamed to `events` to potentially better describe a collection of events if applicable.
- `msg` is renamed to `message` for increased clarity.

However, whether these changes are necessary or useful depends on the broader context of the codebase and team preferences. If `testEvent` indeed refers to a single event and abbreviations like `msg` are standard in the codebase, then no renaming would be necessary.
