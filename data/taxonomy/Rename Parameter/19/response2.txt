In the provided code snippet:

```java
void accept(String authPluginClassName, String authParams) throws UnsupportedAuthenticationException;
```

The parameter names `authPluginClassName` and `authParams` already provide clear, descriptive names that match their expected content types:

- `authPluginClassName` clearly suggests that it expects a class name for an authentication plugin.
- `authParams` suggests that it accepts parameters for authentication, likely in a structured format such as a string.

However, if the goal is to slightly refine the clarity or consistency, you could consider renaming `authParams` to `authParameters` to avoid abbreviation and maintain uniformity in naming style. This can slightly enhance readability by using the full term, making the code more self-explanatory and consistent with common Java naming conventions that favor clarity over brevity. Here is the refactored version:

```java
void accept(String authPluginClassName, String authParameters) throws UnsupportedAuthenticationException;
```

This change is minimal and mostly stylistic but aligns with the goal of making all parameter names fully descriptive and avoiding abbreviations where not necessary. If your team generally prefers full words for clarity, this refactoring would be suitable. If abbreviations like `params` are common and understood within your codebase, the original code may not need this change.
