The provided code snippet for `formatTick` appears well-organized and specific in its naming, but there are still some opportunities for minor refactoring to enhance clarity and maintainability:

1. **Enhanced Comment Clarity:** The comment about caching and volatile fields could be clarified for better understanding.
2. **Variable Renaming for Clarity:** The method parameters and local variables like `_tzFormat1` and `_tzFormat2` could be renamed to be more descriptive about what they represent.
3. **Extracting Repeated Logic:** The logic for checking if a tick matches the current second is repeated for `tick1` and `tick2`. This could be extracted into a separate method to reduce duplication and enhance readability.

Here is how the refactored code might look:

```java
protected Tick formatTick(long currentTimeMillis)
{
    long seconds = currentTimeMillis / 1000;

    // Enhance comment clarity:
    // Two ticks are cached to minimize recalculations and reduce jitter when times are monotonically increasing.
    // Ticks are stored in a volatile field, which carries a small risk of benign recalculations due to concurrent modifications.
    TickHolder holder = _tickHolder;
    Tick cachedTick = getCachedTickIfAvailable(holder, seconds);
    if (cachedTick != null) {
        return cachedTick;
    }

    String formattedPrefix = formatTime(currentTimeMillis, _timeZoneFormatPrimary);
    String formattedSuffix = formatTime(currentTimeMillis, _timeZoneFormatSecondary);
    Tick newTick = new Tick(seconds, formattedPrefix, formattedSuffix);
    _tickHolder = new TickHolder(newTick, holder == null ? null : holder.tick1);
    return newTick;
}

private Tick getCachedTickIfAvailable(TickHolder holder, long seconds) {
    if (holder != null) {
        if (holder.tick1 != null && holder.tick1.getSeconds() == seconds)
            return holder.tick1;
        if (holder.tick2 != null && holder.tick2.getSeconds() == seconds)
            return holder.tick2;
    }
    return null;
}

private String formatTime(long timeMillis, String timeZoneFormat) {
    return doFormat(timeMillis, timeZoneFormat);
}
```

Changes made:
- Renamed `now` to `currentTimeMillis` to better indicate it represents time in milliseconds.
- Renamed `_tzFormat1` and `_tzFormat2` to `_timeZoneFormatPrimary` and `_timeZoneFormatSecondary` for better clarity.
- Extracted repeated tick-check logic into `getCachedTickIfAvailable` method.
- Extracted time formatting into `formatTime` method for better modularity and clarity.

These changes aim to make the code easier to understand and maintain, aligning with common refactoring goals.
