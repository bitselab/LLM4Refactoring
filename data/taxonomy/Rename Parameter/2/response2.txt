In the provided code snippet, the parameter name `ignore` does not clearly indicate its purpose in the context of the method `getReader`. Since the parameter represents the character set that will be used for reading, a more descriptive and appropriate name would be better suited for clarity and readability.

Here's the refactored code with an improved parameter name:

```java
@Override
public Reader getReader(final Charset charset) throws IOException {
    return new CharSequenceReader(get());
}
```

In this refactoring, the parameter name was changed from `ignore` to `charset`, which better describes its role as the character set used by the `Reader`. This makes the code more readable and understandable.
