The given code can indeed benefit from some rename parameter refactorings to enhance readability and better communicate the purpose of each parameter. Here are some suggestions for renaming the parameters:

1. **jdbcMutations** to **mutationOperations**: This renaming provides a clearer description of what the list contains, emphasizing the operations rather than the JDBC technology, which might not be as relevant in this naming context.

2. **mutationType** is clear enough and descriptive of its role, so it doesn't require changes.

3. **mutationTarget** to **generatedValuesDelegate**: This renaming better describes what the object is responsible for, which is handling generated values during mutations.

4. **session** to **databaseSession**: This makes it clear that the session is related to database operations, which could improve readability especially for those unfamiliar with the specific technology being used.

Refactoring the parameter names in the method signature would result in the following updated code snippet:
```java
private static SortedMap<String, PreparedStatementDetails> createStatementDetailsMap(
        List<PreparableMutationOperation> mutationOperations,
        MutationType mutationType,
        GeneratedValuesMutationDelegate generatedValuesDelegate,
        SharedSessionContractImplementor databaseSession) {
    final Comparator<String> comparator;

    if (mutationType == MutationType.DELETE) {
        // reverse order
        comparator = Comparator.comparingInt((tableName) -> {
            final TableMapping tableMapping = locateTableMapping(mutationOperations, tableName);
            if (tableMapping == null) {
                return -1;
            }
            return mutationOperations.size() - tableMapping.getRelativePosition();
        });
    } else {
        comparator = Comparator.comparingInt((tableName) -> {
            final TableMapping tableMapping = locateTableMapping(mutationOperations, tableName);
            if (tableMapping == null) {
                return -1;
            }
            return tableMapping.getRelativePosition();
        });
    }

    final TreeMap<String, PreparedStatementDetails> map = new TreeMap<>(comparator);

    for (final PreparableMutationOperation mutationOperation : mutationOperations) {
        map.put(
                mutationOperation.getTableDetails().getTableName(),
                createPreparedStatementDetails(mutationOperation, generatedValuesDelegate, databaseSession)
        );
    }

    return map;
}
```

These refactorings aim to make the code more understandable by using names that better describe the roles of the variables and parameters.
