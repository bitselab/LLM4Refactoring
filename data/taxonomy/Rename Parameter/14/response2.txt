In the provided code snippet, there is an opportunity to apply a rename parameter refactoring to make the parameter name more consistent with its type. Specifically, renaming the parameter `value` to `newTerm` will make the code clearer and more readable.

Here is the refactored code:

```java
@Override
public WeightedSpanTerm put(K key, WeightedSpanTerm newTerm) {
    WeightedSpanTerm prevTerm = super.put(key, newTerm);
    if (prevTerm != null && prevTerm.positionSensitive == false) {
        newTerm.positionSensitive = false;
    }
    return prevTerm;
}
```

In this refactoring, the parameter `value` is renamed to `newTerm` to better reflect that it is a `WeightedSpanTerm` object being added to the map. This enhances the readability and maintainability of the code.
