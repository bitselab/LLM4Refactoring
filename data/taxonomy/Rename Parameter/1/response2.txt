The code snippet you provided can benefit from a rename parameter refactoring to enhance the clarity of the identifiers and thus improve the readability of the code. Hereâ€™s a review of the existing parameters:

1. `AuditEvent event` - This parameter name is clear as it describes exactly what it holds, an event of type `AuditEvent`.
2. `String severityLevelNameLength` - The name of this parameter is misleading. It suggests that the parameter holds a length (an integer), but it is actually a `String`. A more appropriate name would reflect that it is a string related to the severity level, not its length.

Here is the refactored code snippet with a more appropriate name for the `severityLevelNameLength` parameter:

```java
private static StringBuilder initStringBuilderWithOptimalBuffer(AuditEvent event,
                                                                String severityLevelName) {
    final int bufLen = LENGTH_OF_ALL_SEPARATORS + event.getFileName().length()
            + event.getMessage().length() + severityLevelName.length()
            + getCheckShortName(event).length();
    return new StringBuilder(bufLen);
}
```

In this refactoring, `severityLevelNameLength` has been renamed to `severityLevelName` to accurately reflect that the parameter is a string representing the name of the severity level, not its length. This change should make the purpose of the parameter clearer to anyone reading or maintaining the code.
