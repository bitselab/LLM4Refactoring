Rename parameter refactorings are frequently employed to modify low-quality identifiers to improve readability.
##################################################
A rename parameter refactoring pattern is to rename parameters that are inconsistent with attributes within the same class. Here is an example of the rename parameter refactoring that follows this pattern.
The source code before refactoring is:
```
public class KeyStoreInformation {

    private final char[] keyStorePassword;
    private final char[] keyPassword;
    private final KeyStore keyStore;

    public KeyStoreInformation(KeyStore keyStorePath, char[] keyStorePassword, char[] keyPassword)
    {
        this.keyStore = keyStorePath;
        this.keyStorePassword = keyStorePassword;
        this.keyPassword = keyPassword;
    }
}
```
The source code after refactoring is:
```
public class KeyStoreInformation {

    private final char[] keyStorePassword;
    private final char[] keyPassword;
    private final KeyStore keyStore;

    public KeyStoreInformation(KeyStore keyStore, char[] keyStorePassword, char[] keyPassword)
    {
        this.keyStore = keyStore;
        this.keyStorePassword = keyStorePassword;
        this.keyPassword = keyPassword;
    }
}
```
In this example, the developer renamed the parameter "keyStorePath" to "keyStore".

As a developer, imagine your team leader requests you to review a piece of code to identify potential rename parameter refactoring opportunities that follows the refactoring pattern above. The original code snippet is as follows:
```
public static final class Builder<T> {

    private String[] excludeFieldNames = ArrayUtils.EMPTY_STRING_ARRAY;
    private DiffBuilder<T> diffBuilder;

    public Builder<T> setExcludeFieldNames(final String... excludeFieldNamesParam) {
        this.excludeFieldNames = toExcludeFieldNames(excludeFieldNamesParam);
        return this;
    }

}

```
If there are any refactoring opportunities, please do it and generate the refactored code. Otherwise, simply state that no refactoring is necessary.
