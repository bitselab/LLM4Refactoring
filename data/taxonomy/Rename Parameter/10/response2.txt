In the provided code snippet, there is a potential opportunity for rename parameter refactoring to improve the clarity of the parameters and align with typical naming conventions for such operations. The parameters `xml1` and `actual` can be renamed to more descriptive terms, particularly to reflect their role in the method more clearly.

Here's a refactored version of the code with updated parameter names to improve readability and context:

```java
public void assertXMLEquals(String expectedXML, String actualXML) throws SAXException, IOException {
    final Document expectedDocument = getDocument(expectedXML);
    final Document actualDocument = getDocument(actualXML);

    if (!expectedDocument.isEqualNode(actualDocument)) {
        try {
            fail(String.format("-- expected:\n%s-- actual:\n%s",
                    getXML(expectedDocument), getXML(actualDocument)));
        } catch(TransformerException ex) {
            fail(String.format(""
                            + "expected: <%s>, but it was <%s>\n"
                            + "Additionally, a TransformerException was raised when trying to report XML document contents",
                    expectedXML, actualXML), ex);
        }
    }
}
```

In this refactored code:
- The parameter `xml1` is renamed to `expectedXML` to indicate that it holds the XML content expected to match.
- The parameter `actual` is renamed to `actualXML` to indicate that it holds the XML content being tested against the expected content.

These changes make it clearer what each parameter represents, aiding in the understanding and maintenance of the code.
