In the provided code snippet, there are a few opportunities for rename parameter refactoring that could enhance clarity and better reflect the role or usage of the parameters within the method context. Here are the changes suggested:

1. Rename `first` to `formatExpression` to clarify that this parameter is primarily used to hold the formatting expression, especially when `date` is not null.
2. Rename `date` to `dateExpression` to clearly differentiate it from the potential interpretation as an actual date object, making it clear that it is an expression that should evaluate to a date.

Here's the refactored code with the suggested changes:
```java
@FunctionInfo(returnType = "keyword", description = "Returns a string representation of a date, in the provided format.")
public DateFormat(
        Source source,
        @Param(optional = true, name = "format", type = { "keyword" }, description = "A valid date pattern") Expression formatExpression,
        @Param(name = "date", type = { "date" }, description = "Date expression") Expression dateExpression,
        Configuration configuration
) {
    super(source, dateExpression != null ? List.of(formatExpression, dateExpression) : List.of(formatExpression), configuration);
    this.field = dateExpression != null ? dateExpression : formatExpression;
    this.format = dateExpression != null ? formatExpression : null;
}
```
These changes enhance readability and clarify the role of each parameter within the method, aligning with the rename parameter refactoring pattern outlined earlier.
