After reviewing the code for the `BouncyCastleGpgKeyLocator` class, there are potential opportunities for rename parameter refactoring to enhance clarity and readability, specifically around the methods that deal with keys and IDs. Here are some suggestions:

1. **Method `findSecretKeyInLegacySecring`**:
   - Parameter `signingkey` could be renamed to `signingKeyId` to clarify that it expects an ID rather than a key object or other form of key representation.

2. **Method `findPublicKeyInPubring` and `findPublicKeyInKeyBox`**:
   - Parameters `keyId` and `keySpec` could benefit from renaming to provide a clearer distinction between their uses:
     - `keyId` could be renamed to `fingerprintOrKeyId` to indicate it might accept a fingerprint as well as a key ID.
     - `keySpec` could be renamed to `userIdOrKeyDescriptor` to better describe that it can be a user ID or some other form of key descriptor.

3. **Method `attemptParseSecretKey`**:
   - `keyFile` is fine as it is descriptive of the parameter's purpose.
   - `calculatorProvider` could be renamed to `digestCalculatorProvider` to be more explicit about the type of provider it is.
   - `passphraseSupplier` could be clarified, though it's already quite descriptive. If changed, something like `keyPassphraseSupplier` might denote its specific purpose a bit more directly.

Implementing these changes will make the method signatures more descriptive, which helps other developers understand the usage and expectations more quickly and accurately. Here's the refactored code based on these suggestions:

```java
/**
 * Locates GPG keys from either <code>~/.gnupg/private-keys-v1.d</code> or
 * <code>~/.gnupg/secring.gpg</code>
 */
public class BouncyCastleGpgKeyLocator {
    // Class content remains unchanged until specific methods

    private PGPSecretKey attemptParseSecretKey(Path keyFile,
                                               PGPDigestCalculatorProvider digestCalculatorProvider,
                                               SecretKeys.PassphraseSupplier keyPassphraseSupplier,
                                               PGPPublicKey publicKey)
            throws IOException, PGPException, CanceledException,
            UnsupportedCredentialItem, URISyntaxException {
        // Method content remains unchanged
    }

    private PGPSecretKey findSecretKeyInLegacySecring(String signingKeyId,
                                                      Path secringFile) throws IOException, PGPException {
        // Method content remains unchanged
    }

    private static PGPPublicKey findPublicKeyInPubring(Path pubringFile,
                                                       String fingerprintOrKeyId, String userIdOrKeyDescriptor)
            throws IOException, PGPException {
        // Method content remains unchanged
    }

    private static PGPPublicKey findPublicKeyInKeyBox(Path keyboxFile,
                                                      String fingerprintOrKeyId, String userIdOrKeyDescriptor)
            throws IOException, NoSuchAlgorithmException,
            NoSuchProviderException, NoOpenPgpKeyException {
        // Method content remains unchanged
    }
}
```

These refactorings focus on making parameter names more intuitive and aligned with their usage within the methods, improving maintainability and clarity of the codebase.
