Reviewing the given code snippet from `ClosedInputStreamTest`, it's evident that there is some duplicate logic that can be factored out using the extract method refactoring pattern. This involves identifying repetitive code blocks and encapsulating them into a new method to improve code readability and maintainability.

In the provided code snippet:
```java
public class ClosedInputStreamTest {

    @Test
    public void testRead() throws Exception {
        try (ClosedInputStream cis = new ClosedInputStream()) {
            assertEquals(EOF, cis.read(), "read()");
        }
    }

    @Test
    public void testSingleton() throws Exception {
        try (@SuppressWarnings("deprecation")
             ClosedInputStream cis = ClosedInputStream.CLOSED_INPUT_STREAM) {
            assertEquals(EOF, cis.read(), "read()");
        }
        try (ClosedInputStream cis = ClosedInputStream.INSTANCE) {
            assertEquals(EOF, cis.read(), "read()");
        }
    }

}
```

The following code block is repeated across different test cases:
```java
assertEquals(EOF, cis.read(), "read()");
```
This repetition occurs within the context of a `try` block with resource management. We can extract this as a method, such as `assertReadEOF(ClosedInputStream cis)`, which encapsulates the assertion logic and can be reused in each test case.

Here's the refactored code with the extracted method:
```java
public class ClosedInputStreamTest {

    @Test
    public void testRead() throws Exception {
        try (ClosedInputStream cis = new ClosedInputStream()) {
            assertReadEOF(cis);
        }
    }

    @Test
    public void testSingleton() throws Exception {
        try (@SuppressWarnings("deprecation")
             ClosedInputStream cis = ClosedInputStream.CLOSED_INPUT_STREAM) {
            assertReadEOF(cis);
        }
        try (ClosedInputStream cis = ClosedInputStream.INSTANCE) {
            assertReadEOF(cis);
        }
    }

    private void assertReadEOF(ClosedInputStream cis) throws IOException {
        assertEquals(EOF, cis.read(), "read()");
    }
}
```
This refactoring simplifies the test methods by abstracting out the repetitive assertion into a single method, enhancing the clarity and maintainability of the test class.
