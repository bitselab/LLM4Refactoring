Analyzing the provided `FileBasedConfig` class method `load()`, there are several portions of the method that could potentially be refactored for improved readability and maintainability by extracting them into separate methods. The method currently handles file reading, snapshot comparison, hash checking, decoding file content, and managing the state of snapshots and hash values. These responsibilities can be organized better through method extraction.

### Potential Refactoring Opportunities:

1. **Extracting Snapshot Comparison Logic**:
   This portion involves comparing old and new snapshots and updating states based on their comparison.

2. **Extracting Decoding Logic**:
   The decoding of file bytes into strings based on character encoding can be extracted.

3. **Extracting Hash Checking and Update Logic**:
   This involves checking if the current hash matches the newly calculated hash and updating the snapshot and hash accordingly.

Let's perform these refactorings on the provided code:

```java
public class FileBasedConfig extends StoredConfig {

    @Override
    public void load() throws IOException, ConfigInvalidException {
        lock.readLock().lock();
        try {
            Boolean wasRead = FileUtils.readWithRetries(getFile(), f -> {
                FileSnapshot oldSnapshot = snapshot;
                FileSnapshot newSnapshot = FileSnapshot.saveNoConfig(f);
                byte[] in = IO.readFully(f);
                ObjectId newHash = hash(in);

                updateSnapshotIfNeeded(oldSnapshot, newSnapshot, newHash, in);
                
                return Boolean.TRUE;
            });
            if (wasRead == null) {
                clear();
                snapshot = FileSnapshot.MISSING_FILE;
            }
            exists.set(wasRead != null);
        } catch (IOException e) {
            throw e;
        } catch (Exception e) {
            throw new ConfigInvalidException(MessageFormat
                    .format(JGitText.get().cannotReadFile, getFile()), e);
        } finally {
            lock.readLock().unlock();
        }
    }

    private void updateSnapshotIfNeeded(FileSnapshot oldSnapshot, FileSnapshot newSnapshot, ObjectId newHash, byte[] in) throws UnsupportedEncodingException {
        if (hash.equals(newHash)) {
            if (oldSnapshot.equals(newSnapshot)) {
                oldSnapshot.setClean(newSnapshot);
            } else {
                snapshot = newSnapshot;
            }
        } else {
            String decoded = decodeFileContents(in);
            fromText(decoded);
            snapshot = newSnapshot;
            hash = newHash;
        }
    }

    private String decodeFileContents(byte[] in) throws UnsupportedEncodingException {
        if (isUtf8(in)) {
            return RawParseUtils.decode(UTF_8, in, 3, in.length);
        } else {
            return RawParseUtils.decode(in);
        }
    }

}
```

### Refactoring Breakdown:
- **`updateSnapshotIfNeeded`**: This new method handles the logic of comparing the old and new snapshots, as well as deciding whether to update the snapshot based on the hash.
- **`decodeFileContents`**: This method handles the decoding of the file's contents into a string based on the encoding type detected.

These refactorings help to decompose the `load()` method into more manageable parts and make the logic clearer and more modular.
