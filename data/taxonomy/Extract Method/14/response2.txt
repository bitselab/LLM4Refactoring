The provided code snippet involves two methods: `getNextTransition` and `getTransition`. These methods share a significant portion of logic related to setting the `Transition` object's properties based on the state transitions. Here, we can apply the "Extract Method" refactoring pattern by extracting the common code into a new method, improving code readability and maintainability.

### Refactoring Steps

1. **Identify the common code**: Both methods calculate the `dest`, `min`, and `max` properties of the `Transition` object in the same way.

2. **Extract the common code into a new method**: We will create a method `setTransitionProperties` to set these properties, reducing code duplication.

Here's the refactored code:

```java
public class NFARunAutomaton implements ByteRunnable, TransitionAccessor {

    @Override
    public void getNextTransition(Transition t) {
        assert t.transitionUpto < points.length - 1 && t.transitionUpto >= -1;
        while (dStates[t.source].transitions[++t.transitionUpto] == MISSING) {
            // this shouldn't throw AIOOBE as long as this function is only called
            // numTransitions times
        }
        assert dStates[t.source].transitions[t.transitionUpto] != NOT_COMPUTED;

        setTransitionProperties(t);
    }
    
    @Override
    public void getTransition(int state, int index, Transition t) {
        dStates[state].determinize();
        int outgoingTransitions = -1;
        t.transitionUpto = -1;
        t.source = state;
        while (outgoingTransitions < index && t.transitionUpto < points.length - 1) {
            if (dStates[t.source].transitions[++t.transitionUpto] != MISSING) {
                outgoingTransitions++;
            }
        }
        assert outgoingTransitions == index;

        setTransitionProperties(t);
    }

    private void setTransitionProperties(Transition t) {
        t.dest = dStates[t.source].transitions[t.transitionUpto];
        t.min = points[t.transitionUpto];
        if (t.transitionUpto == points.length - 1) {
            t.max = alphabetSize - 1;
        } else {
            t.max = points[t.transitionUpto + 1] - 1;
        }
    }
}
```

### Benefits of This Refactoring

- **Reduced Code Duplication**: The repetitive code for setting the properties of `Transition` is now centralized in one method, reducing duplication and potential errors.
- **Improved Readability**: The main methods now focus more on their primary responsibilities, making the code easier to understand at a glance.
- **Easier Maintenance**: Any future changes to how transitions are handled only need to be made in one place, simplifying maintenance.

This refactoring is a textbook example of improving the design of software through simple, effective changes.
