The provided code snippet is well-structured and the variable names are clear and descriptive. However, a potential rename variable refactoring can be made to align variable names better with common Java coding standards and to enhance readability. Here are the changes:

1. Rename `position` to `initialPosition` - This change clarifies that this variable holds the starting position for reading operations, distinguishing it from the offsets applied during various operations.
2. Rename `readlimit` to `readLimit` - This change improves readability by adhering to camelCase convention commonly used in Java for variable names.

Here is the refactored code with these changes:

```java
@Test
public void testMarkAndReset() throws Exception {
    int initialPosition = 0;
    final int readLimit = 10;
    try (InputStream input = new TestNullInputStream(100, true, false)) {

        assertTrue(input.markSupported(), "Mark Should be Supported");

        // No Mark
        final IOException noMarkException = assertThrows(IOException.class, input::reset);
        assertEquals("No position has been marked", noMarkException.getMessage(), "No Mark IOException message");

        for (; initialPosition < 3; initialPosition++) {
            assertEquals(initialPosition, input.read(), "Read Before Mark [" + initialPosition + "]");
        }

        // Mark
        input.mark(readLimit);

        // Read further
        for (int i = 0; i < 3; i++) {
            assertEquals(initialPosition + i, input.read(), "Read After Mark [" + i + "]");
        }

        // Reset
        input.reset();

        // Read From marked position
        for (int i = 0; i < readLimit + 1; i++) {
            assertEquals(initialPosition + i, input.read(), "Read After Reset [" + i + "]");
        }

        // Reset after read limit passed
        final IOException resetException = assertThrows(IOException.class, input::reset, "Read limit exceeded, expected IOException");
        assertEquals("Marked position [" + initialPosition + "] is no longer valid - passed the read limit [" + readLimit + "]", resetException.getMessage(),
                "Read limit IOException message");
    }
}
```

These changes are minor but improve the overall quality and readability of the code by ensuring consistency with Java naming conventions.
