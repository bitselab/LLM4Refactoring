In the provided code snippet from the `BatchAutoConfiguration` class, a potential opportunity for rename variable refactoring exists in the `jobLauncherApplicationRunner` method, based on the pattern of aligning variable names more closely with the method calls or functionalities they are associated with.

Original snippet:
```java
public JobLauncherApplicationRunner jobLauncherApplicationRunner(JobLauncher jobLauncher, JobExplorer jobExplorer,
                                                                 JobRepository jobRepository, BatchProperties properties) {
    JobLauncherApplicationRunner runner = new JobLauncherApplicationRunner(jobLauncher, jobExplorer, jobRepository);
    String jobNames = properties.getJob().getName();
    if (StringUtils.hasText(jobNames)) {
        runner.setJobName(jobNames);
    }
    return runner;
}
```

In this method, the variable `jobNames` is used to store the result of `properties.getJob().getName()`. The name `jobNames` suggests it might hold multiple job names, but in this context, it's used to hold just one job name. To better reflect this and align with your example of renaming a variable to be consistent with its usage, it might be better renamed to `jobName`.

Refactored snippet:
```java
public JobLauncherApplicationRunner jobLauncherApplicationRunner(JobLauncher jobLauncher, JobExplorer jobExplorer,
                                                                 JobRepository jobRepository, BatchProperties properties) {
    JobLauncherApplicationRunner runner = new JobLauncherApplicationRunner(jobLauncher, jobExplorer, jobRepository);
    String jobName = properties.getJob().getName(); // Renamed variable from jobNames to jobName
    if (StringUtils.hasText(jobName)) {
        runner.setJobName(jobName);
    }
    return runner;
}
```

This change improves readability and makes the variable's purpose clearer, indicating it stores a single job name, not multiple names. This is consistent with your described pattern of renaming variables to improve clarity and consistency.
