In the provided code snippet, there is an opportunity to apply a rename variable refactoring pattern to improve clarity and consistency in variable naming, similar to the previous example you provided. The variable `jobNames` could be better named to reflect that it may potentially handle multiple job names as a single string. A more descriptive name like `jobNameProperty` might be clearer, indicating that this variable represents the job name property value from `BatchProperties`.

Here's the refactored code:

```java
@Bean
@ConditionalOnMissingBean
@ConditionalOnProperty(prefix = "spring.batch.job", name = "enabled", havingValue = "true", matchIfMissing = true)
public JobLauncherApplicationRunner jobLauncherApplicationRunner(JobLauncher jobLauncher, JobExplorer jobExplorer,
                                                                 JobRepository jobRepository, BatchProperties properties) {
    JobLauncherApplicationRunner runner = new JobLauncherApplicationRunner(jobLauncher, jobExplorer, jobRepository);
    String jobNameProperty = properties.getJob().getName();
    if (StringUtils.hasText(jobNameProperty)) {
        runner.setJobName(jobNameProperty);
    }
    return runner;
}
```

In this refactoring:
- I renamed `jobNames` to `jobNameProperty` to more accurately describe the variable as holding the property value that specifies the name of the job(s).

This change enhances readability by more clearly stating the purpose and context of the variable within the method.
