In the provided code snippet, I notice a couple of opportunities where renaming variables could improve clarity, especially concerning their type and role in the context of the method:

1. `switchStmt` could be more descriptively named to reflect its role and type. Since it represents a `SwitchNode`, a more descriptive name like `currentSwitchNode` might clarify that it pertains to the current context of the `SwitchNode` being processed.

2. `typeDeclaration` is used within a conditional block checking if the type is an enumeration. A more explicit name such as `enumTypeDeclaration` might be clearer, indicating that this variable specifically references an enumeration type declaration.

3. `referenceType` is used within the context of handling a reference type implementation. A clearer name like `specificReferenceType` could better denote that it refers to a more narrowly defined `ReferenceTypeImpl`.

4. `typeUsageTypeDeclaration` is a little redundant and can be streamlined for better readability. Renaming it to `resolvedRefTypeDecl` could better convey its purpose and reduce verbosity while clarifying that it is a resolved reference type declaration.

Here is how the refactored code would look:

```java
@Override
public SymbolReference<? extends ResolvedValueDeclaration> solveSymbol(String name) {
    SwitchNode currentSwitchNode = (SwitchNode) demandParentNode(wrappedNode);
    ResolvedType type = JavaParserFacade.get(typeSolver).getType(currentSwitchNode.getSelector());
    if (type.isReferenceType() && type.asReferenceType().getTypeDeclaration().isPresent()) {
        ResolvedReferenceTypeDeclaration enumTypeDeclaration = type.asReferenceType().getTypeDeclaration().get();
        if (enumTypeDeclaration.isEnum()) {
            if (type instanceof ReferenceTypeImpl) {
                ReferenceTypeImpl specificReferenceType = (ReferenceTypeImpl) type;
                if(specificReferenceType.getTypeDeclaration().isPresent()) {
                    ResolvedReferenceTypeDeclaration resolvedRefTypeDecl = specificReferenceType.getTypeDeclaration().get();
                    if (resolvedRefTypeDecl.asEnum().hasEnumConstant(name)) {
                        return SymbolReference.solved(resolvedRefTypeDecl.asEnum().getEnumConstant(name));
                    }
                    if (resolvedRefTypeDecl.hasField(name)) {
                        return SymbolReference.solved(resolvedRefTypeDecl.getField(name));
                    }
                } else {
                    // Consider IllegalStateException or similar?
                }
            } else {
                throw new UnsupportedOperationException();
            }
        }
    }

    // look for declaration in this and previous switch entry statements
    for (SwitchEntry seStmt : currentSwitchNode.getEntries()) {
        for (Statement stmt : seStmt.getStatements()) {
            SymbolDeclarator symbolDeclarator = JavaParserFactory.getSymbolDeclarator(stmt, typeSolver);
            SymbolReference<? extends ResolvedValueDeclaration> symbolReference = solveWith(symbolDeclarator, name);
            if (symbolReference.isSolved()) {
                return symbolReference;
            }
        }
        // once we reach this switch entry statement, stop: we do not want to look in later switch entry statements
        if (seStmt == wrappedNode) {
            break;
        }
    }

    return solveSymbolInParentContext(name);
}
```

These changes aim to enhance readability by making the variable names more descriptive and type-appropriate, following the pattern you've indicated.
