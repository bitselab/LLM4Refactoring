In the provided code snippet, the variable `tag` is used to traverse nodes until a node that is not a `LEADING_ASTERISK` or `NEWLINE` is found. The name `tag` might be misleading or less informative because it does not clearly express what the variable is used for or its role within the function. A more appropriate name might be `currentNode` or `nearestNode`, as these names would better describe the purpose of the variable as a reference to the currently examined node in the search for the nearest relevant node.

Here's the code snippet with the refactored variable name:

```java
private static DetailNode getNearestNode(DetailNode node) {
    DetailNode currentNode = node;
    while (currentNode.getType() == JavadocTokenTypes.LEADING_ASTERISK
            || currentNode.getType() == JavadocTokenTypes.NEWLINE) {
        currentNode = JavadocUtil.getNextSibling(currentNode);
    }
    return currentNode;
}
```

In this refactored code, `currentNode` is used instead of `tag`, which makes it clearer that this variable holds the node currently being inspected in the loop. This change improves code readability by making the purpose of the variable more apparent.
