In reviewing the provided code snippet for potential rename variable refactoring opportunities that align with the given pattern, I focused on identifying any inconsistencies between variable names and the methods or values they are associated with. The goal was to ensure variable names accurately reflect their content or use, enhancing readability and maintainability.

Upon thorough examination of the code, all variable names appear to be well-chosen and align well with their purpose and usage within the context of the methods they are employed. For instance, variables such as `readPosition`, `writePosition`, `capacity`, and `byteBuffer` are named appropriately given their roles within the `DefaultDataBuffer` class. Method names like `readableByteCount` and `writableByteCount` also accurately reflect what the methods calculate and return.

Here are some specifics:
- `readPosition` and `writePosition` accurately denote positions for reading and writing within the buffer, respectively.
- `byteBuffer` is a standard and appropriate name for a variable of type `ByteBuffer`.
- `capacity`, `readableByteCount`, and `writableByteCount` are straightforward and descriptive regarding their functionalities.

No changes are suggested regarding renaming variables as they all fit well with their context and the operations they perform, which aligns with the original purpose of rename variable refactoringsâ€”to enhance clarity and consistency.

Therefore, no refactoring is necessary for this code snippet.
