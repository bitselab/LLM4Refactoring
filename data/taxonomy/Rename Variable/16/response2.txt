In the provided code snippet, there is an opportunity to apply the rename variable refactoring pattern that focuses on renaming variables to be consistent with their method calls or context.

Here's the original code:

```java
@Override
@Deprecated
public ByteBuffer asByteBuffer(int index, int length) {
    checkIndex(index, length);

    ByteBuffer duplicate = this.byteBuffer.duplicate();
    duplicate.position(index);
    duplicate.limit(index + length);
    return duplicate.slice();
}
```

The variable `duplicate` is used to store a `ByteBuffer` obtained from duplicating another `ByteBuffer`. The variable name `duplicate` could be more specific to reflect its purpose more clearly. Given that the methods called on this `ByteBuffer` are `position` and `limit`, a possible renaming could focus on its intended use, which appears to be creating a sliced `ByteBuffer` based on a given position and limit.

Refactored code:
```java
@Override
@Deprecated
public ByteBuffer asByteBuffer(int index, int length) {
    checkIndex(index, length);

    ByteBuffer bufferSlice = this.byteBuffer.duplicate();
    bufferSlice.position(index);
    bufferSlice.limit(index + length);
    return bufferSlice.slice();
}
```

Here, I've renamed `duplicate` to `bufferSlice`, which suggests that the `ByteBuffer` is intended to be sliced from the original buffer. This naming provides clearer intent and readability.
