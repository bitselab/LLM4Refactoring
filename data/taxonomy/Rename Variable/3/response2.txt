Reviewing the code snippet provided for potential rename variable refactoring opportunities, the primary goal is to ensure that variable names clearly reflect their types and uses within the context of the code.

The code snippet tests the immutability of a list of differences between two objects of type `SimpleClass`. Here's the analysis of the current variable names:

1. `lhs` and `rhs` are common shorthand in comparisons, standing for "left-hand side" and "right-hand side" respectively. These are clear in their context, especially in a diff scenario.
2. `diffs` clearly indicates a collection of differences.
3. `list` represents the result of the diff operation, encapsulating the differences, the compared objects, and some formatting details. The variable name `list` is somewhat generic and could potentially be renamed to better reflect its type and purpose, such as `diffResult`.

Given the above analysis, the only potential rename variable refactoring opportunity that aligns with the pattern of ensuring consistency with type and purpose is renaming `list` to `diffResult`. This change would make it clearer that the variable holds a result object from a diff operation rather than a generic list.

Here is the refactored code:

```java
@Test
public void testListIsNonModifiable() {
    final SimpleClass lhs = new SimpleClass(true);
    final SimpleClass rhs = new SimpleClass(false);

    final List<Diff<?>> diffs = lhs.diff(rhs).getDiffs();

    final DiffResult<SimpleClass> diffResult = new DiffResult<>(lhs, rhs, diffs, SHORT_STYLE, DiffBuilder.TO_STRING_FORMAT);
    assertEquals(diffs, diffResult.getDiffs());
    assertEquals(1, diffResult.getNumberOfDiffs());
    assertThrows(UnsupportedOperationException.class, () -> diffResult.getDiffs().remove(0));
}
```

In this refactoring, `list` has been renamed to `diffResult` to more accurately reflect that it is a result object from a diff operation, enhancing the readability and clarity of the code.
