The provided code snippet is well-written with clear and contextually appropriate variable names that reflect their purposes and functions within the code. The identifiers like `stateIndex`, `stateTtl`, and `stateName` in the `StateMetadata` class are self-explanatory and correctly describe what they represent. Other variables and method parameters throughout the code also seem to have appropriate names given their usage and context.

For instance:
- `stateIndex` clearly indicates an index related to a state.
- `stateTtl` represents "state Time-to-Live," and it is consistently handled as a `Duration`, which is intuitive for managing time-related values.
- `stateName` is straightforward and descriptive for naming different state types or descriptions.

Given this context, there doesn't appear to be a need for renaming any variables as per the rename variable refactoring pattern described. The current identifiers are already of high quality, contribute to the readability of the code, and match the expected semantics in their respective contexts.

Therefore, no refactoring is necessary in this case.
