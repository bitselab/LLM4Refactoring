In the provided code snippet, there is an opportunity for inline variable refactoring. The variable `file` is used only once in the immediate return statement, so it can be inlined for cleaner and more concise code. This follows the pattern where if a variable is used immediately and only once, it should be inlined.

Here's the refactored code:
```java
private File getUnderlyingFile(Resource resource) {
    try {
        if (resource instanceof ClassPathResource || resource instanceof FileSystemResource
                || resource instanceof FileUrlResource) {
            return resource.getFile().getAbsoluteFile();
        }
    }
    catch (IOException ex) {
        // Ignore
    }
    return null;
}
```
In this refactored version, I've removed the `file` variable and replaced it with the method call chain `resource.getFile().getAbsoluteFile()`. This makes the method slightly more straightforward without affecting its functionality or readability negatively.
