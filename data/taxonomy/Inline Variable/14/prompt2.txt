Inline variable refactorings are frequently employed to eliminate unnecessary variables to improve readability.
##################################################
An inline variable refactoring pattern is to remove variables that are used only once within the method. Here is an example of the inline variable refactoring that follows this pattern.
The source code before refactoring is:
```
public int getNumEntries() throws IOException {
    if (m_closed) {
        open(false);
    }
    if (m_fc.size() > SEGMENT_HEADER_BYTES) {
        final int numEntries = m_buf.b().getInt(COUNT_OFFSET);
        return numEntries;
    } else {
        return 0;
    }
}
```
The source code after refactoring is:
```
public int getNumEntries() throws IOException {
    if (m_closed) {
        open(false);
    }
    if (m_fc.size() > SEGMENT_HEADER_BYTES) {
        return m_buf.b().getInt(COUNT_OFFSET);
    } else {
        return 0;
    }
}
```
In this example, the developer removed the unnecessary variable "numEntries".

As a developer, imagine your team leader requests you to review a piece of code to identify potential inline variable refactoring opportunities that follows the refactoring pattern above. The original code snippet is as follows:
```
public void testMergedFieldInfos_empty() throws IOException {
    Directory dir = newDirectory();
    IndexWriter writer = new IndexWriter(dir, newIndexWriterConfig(new MockAnalyzer(random())));

    IndexReader reader = DirectoryReader.open(writer);
    FieldInfos actual = FieldInfos.getMergedFieldInfos(reader);
    FieldInfos expected = FieldInfos.EMPTY;
    
    assertSame(expected, actual);

    reader.close();
    writer.close();
    dir.close();
}
```
If there are any refactoring opportunities, please do it and generate the refactored code. Otherwise, simply state that no refactoring is necessary.
