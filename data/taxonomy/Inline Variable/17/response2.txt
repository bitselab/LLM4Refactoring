In the provided code snippet, there is indeed an opportunity for inline variable refactoring. The variable `result` is only used to immediately return the value assigned to it, and it doesn't add any clarity or functional purpose beyond what directly returning `stream` would provide. This is a typical scenario where inline variable refactoring can simplify the code and enhance readability.

Here's the refactored version of the code:
```java
@Override
@NonNull
InputStream getInputStream() {
    return stream;
}
```
This change eliminates the unnecessary variable `result` and makes the method more concise.
