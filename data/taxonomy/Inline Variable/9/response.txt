Reviewing the provided code snippet, I looked for opportunities to apply the inline variable refactoring pattern, focusing on variables that are used only once within their scope and do not significantly add to the readability or structure of the code.

Upon inspection, most variables in the code serve a purpose beyond a single use, contributing to clarity, maintaining state across conditional branches, or used in loops. These variables are typically necessary for maintaining the structure and readability of the code.

One potential refactoring found is in the `collectSrcLinesForUntouchedFile` method, where `content` is used only once directly after its declaration:

Original:
```java
final byte[] content;
try {
    content = FileUtil.loadFileBytes(classFile);
}
catch (IOException e) {
    return null;
}
```

Refactored:
```java
try {
    final byte[] content = FileUtil.loadFileBytes(classFile);
}
catch (IOException e) {
    return null;
}
```

However, the refactoring would not be correct because `content` is also used outside the `try` block. Thus, it should not be inlined.

Upon further examination, I couldn't find any straightforward opportunities for inline variable refactoring that would improve the code. Each variable usage appears to serve a specific function that either requires the variable to be maintained over several operations or enhances code readability and maintainability by clearly naming data being processed.

Therefore, no inline variable refactoring is necessary for this code. The variables are used appropriately to enhance code clarity and manage complexity effectively.
