In the given code snippet, we need to determine whether there are any inline variable refactoring opportunities. Let's review the code:

```java
@Test
void mappingRowSimpleObject() {
    MockRow mockRow = SIMPLE_PERSON_ROW;
    BeanPropertyRowMapper<Person> mapper = new BeanPropertyRowMapper<>(Person.class);

    Person result = mapper.apply(mockRow);

    assertThat(result.firstName).as("firstName").isEqualTo("John");
    assertThat(result.lastName).as("lastName").isEqualTo("Doe");
    assertThat(result.age).as("age").isEqualTo(30);
}
```

Here's a breakdown of the usage of each variable:
- `mockRow`: This variable is assigned from `SIMPLE_PERSON_ROW` and used only once in the `mapper.apply(mockRow)` method call.
- `mapper`: This variable is instantiated and used only once in `mapper.apply(mockRow)`.

Given this usage, inline variable refactoring can be applied to both `mockRow` and `mapper` since they are only referenced once and their elimination would still maintain code readability. Hereâ€™s the refactored code:

```java
@Test
void mappingRowSimpleObject() {
    Person result = new BeanPropertyRowMapper<Person>(Person.class).apply(SIMPLE_PERSON_ROW);

    assertThat(result.firstName).as("firstName").isEqualTo("John");
    assertThat(result.lastName).as("lastName").isEqualTo("Doe");
    assertThat(result.age).as("age").isEqualTo(30);
}
```

By inlining `mockRow` and `mapper`, we've removed unnecessary intermediate variables, and the code remains clear and concise.
