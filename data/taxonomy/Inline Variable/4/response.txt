After analyzing the provided Java code snippet, it appears that there are several variables that could be considered for inline variable refactoring, following the pattern of eliminating variables that are only used once. Here are the refactorings I would recommend:

1. **In the `LocalAction` class' `doExecute` method:**
   - The variable `resultsBuilder` is used in several places and thus should not be inlined.

2. **In the `SnapshotDetailsByPolicy` class' `add` method:**
   - The variable `slmPolicy` is used only once in its scope and can be inlined.

3. **In the `getSnapshotDetailsByPolicy` static method:**
   - The variable `snapshotDetailsByPolicy` is used multiple times, so it should not be inlined.

After reviewing the code, the only candidate for inline variable refactoring is `slmPolicy` in the `add` method of the `SnapshotDetailsByPolicy` class. However, due to the fact that the use of `slmPolicy` may contribute to readability and clarity, inlining it might not significantly enhance the code. If you still prefer to see how the inlining would look for educational purposes, here's the refactored snippet for the `add` method:

Original method:
```java
synchronized void add(SnapshotId snapshotId, RepositoryData.SnapshotDetails snapshotDetails) {
    assert RETAINABLE_STATES.contains(snapshotDetails.getSnapshotState());
    final var slmPolicy = snapshotDetails.getSlmPolicy();
    if (Strings.hasLength(slmPolicy)) {
        snapshotsByPolicy.computeIfAbsent(slmPolicy, ignored -> new HashMap<>()).put(snapshotId, snapshotDetails);
    }
}
```

Refactored method:
```java
synchronized void add(SnapshotId snapshotId, RepositoryData.SnapshotDetails snapshotDetails) {
    assert RETAINABLE_STATES.contains(snapshotDetails.getSnapshotState());
    if (Strings.hasLength(snapshotDetails.getSlmPolicy())) {
        snapshotsByPolicy.computeIfAbsent(snapshotDetails.getSlmPolicy(), ignored -> new HashMap<>()).put(snapshotId, snapshotDetails);
    }
}
```

This change reduces the number of lines and may slightly improve execution performance by removing the temporary variable. However, whether this change is beneficial can be subjective and depends on the team's or individual's preferences for code clarity versus minimalism.
