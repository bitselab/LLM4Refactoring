In the provided code snippet, the method is named `withDefaultCollection`, but the functionality primarily involves setting a default data store (likely for Solr, based on the class and method names) and then returning the builder object for further chaining. The method name suggests it deals specifically with a collection, but the internal implementation directly assigns to a variable that seems more generically named `defaultDataStore`.

Given this context, if the method's primary responsibility is broader than just handling a collection (i.e., it could potentially be setting a default core or any data store), the method name could be improved to reflect this broader functionality.

Refactoring the method name to something like `withDefaultDataStore` would make it more consistent with the body of the method, as it directly manipulates an attribute named `defaultDataStore`.

Here is the refactored code:

```java
public LBHttp2SolrClient.Builder withDefaultDataStore(String defaultCoreOrCollection) {
    this.defaultDataStore = defaultCoreOrCollection;
    return this;
}
```

This refactoring makes the method name more indicative of its effect on the `defaultDataStore` attribute, which can represent a core or collection, enhancing readability and maintainability of the code.
