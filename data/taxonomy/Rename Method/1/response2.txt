In the provided code snippet, the method name is `relativizeAndNormalizePath`. The method's primary functionalities include:

1. Returning the input path as is if `baseDirectory` is `null`.
2. Creating an absolute path from the input `path`, creating a `Path` object from `baseDirectory`, and then relativizing the former against the latter to return a relative path.

The name `relativizeAndNormalizePath` suggests that the method performs two operations: relativizing a path and normalizing it. However, upon examining the method body, it becomes clear that the method does not explicitly perform a normalization (which often involves cleaning up the path syntax, removing redundant components like `..` or `.`) unless this behavior is implicitly included in the `relativize` method from Java's `Path` API.

Given the current implementation of the method, a potential rename could be considered to better reflect what the method actually does:

- If the `relativize` method inherently normalizes the path, the current name might be appropriate.
- If `relativize` does not inherently normalize paths, then a more accurate name might be simply `relativizePath` since that's the primary operation performed when `baseDirectory` is not `null`.

Let's assume the `relativize` method does not inherently normalize paths. Here's the refactored code with the method renamed to better reflect its primary functionality:

```java
public static String relativizePath(final String baseDirectory, final String path) {
    final String resultPath;
    if (baseDirectory == null) {
        resultPath = path;  // Return the path as is if base directory is null
    }
    else {
        final Path pathAbsolute = Paths.get(path);
        final Path pathBase = Paths.get(baseDirectory);
        resultPath = pathBase.relativize(pathAbsolute).toString();  // Relativize the absolute path against the base path
    }
    return resultPath;
}
```

This renaming makes it clearer that the method primarily performs path relativization, assuming no inherent normalization is part of `relativize`. If in practice the `relativize` method does normalize, the original name might still be suitable.
