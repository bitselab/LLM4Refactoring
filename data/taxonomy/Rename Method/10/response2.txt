The provided code snippet handles indentation for a moved node within a text structure, specifically modifying the indentation based on previously encountered whitespace and newline characters. The method name `fixIndentOfMovedNode` accurately describes the operations within the method, which primarily involve adjusting indentation rather than fixing it in the sense of correcting errors or addressing broken elements.

The method name should ideally convey the primary purpose and operations of the method. In this case, the term "fix" might imply correcting errors, while the actual operation is more about adjusting or setting the indentation based on the node's new position. To better reflect this, a rename method refactoring can be applied to change the method name to something more descriptive of its actual functionality.

Here's a suggested refactoring with a new method name that might be more descriptive:

```java
private void adjustIndentationForNode(NodeText nodeText, int index) {
    if (index <= 0) {
        return;
    }
    TextElement currentSpaceCandidate = null;
    for (int i = index; i >= 0; i--) {
        TextElement spaceCandidate = nodeText.getTextElement(i);
        if (spaceCandidate.isSpaceOrTab()) {
            // save the current indentation char
            currentSpaceCandidate = nodeText.getTextElement(i);
        }
        if (!spaceCandidate.isSpaceOrTab()) {
            if (spaceCandidate.isNewline() && i != index) {
                int numberOfIndentationCharacters = index - i;
                for (int j = 0; j < numberOfIndentationCharacters; j++) {
                    if (currentSpaceCandidate != null) {
                        // use the current (or last) indentation character
                        nodeText.addElement(index, new TokenTextElement(JavaToken.Kind.SPACE.getKind(), currentSpaceCandidate.expand()));
                    } else {
                        // use the default indentation character
                        nodeText.addElement(index, new TokenTextElement(JavaToken.Kind.SPACE.getKind()));
                    }
                }
            }
            break;
        }
    }
}
```

In this refactoring, the method name `adjustIndentationForNode` better describes the action of adjusting the node's indentation based on its new position, rather than "fixing" which could be misinterpreted as correcting an error. This change enhances readability and aligns the method name more closely with its body, following the refactoring pattern highlighted earlier.
