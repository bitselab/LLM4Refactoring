In reviewing the given code snippet, the method name `isValid` should accurately reflect the operations performed within the method. The current method name, `isValid`, suggests a straightforward validation check, but the method does more than just validation; it involves invoking methods on annotations and handling exceptions. 

A more descriptive method name would better communicate the method's purpose and behavior. Considering the method's actions, which involve invoking methods on annotations and checking for exceptions, a name that includes these aspects would be more appropriate.

Here is the refactored code with a renamed method:

```java
boolean checkAndInvokeAnnotationMethods(Annotation annotation) {
    assertAnnotation(annotation);
    for (int i = 0; i < size(); i++) {
        if (canThrowTypeNotPresentException(i)) {
            try {
                AnnotationUtils.invokeAnnotationMethod(get(i), annotation);
            }
            catch (IllegalStateException ex) {
                // Plain invocation failure to expose -> leave up to attribute retrieval
                // (if any) where such invocation failure will be logged eventually.
            }
            catch (Throwable ex) {
                // TypeNotPresentException etc. -> annotation type not actually loadable.
                return false;
            }
        }
    }
    return true;
}
```

In this version, the method name `checkAndInvokeAnnotationMethods` better reflects the dual functionality of checking conditions and invoking methods within annotations, providing clearer insight into the method's purpose and the type of operations it performs.
