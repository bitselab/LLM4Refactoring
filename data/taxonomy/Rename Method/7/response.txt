Analyzing the given code snippet for potential rename method refactoring opportunities involves examining whether method names accurately reflect their responsibilities, based on the bodies of these methods. Here are the method names and their primary functionalities:

1. **`performInsert`** - This method orchestrates the entire process of performing an insert operation by logging statements, preparing value bindings, and executing the insert while extracting generated values. The name `performInsert` seems suitable as it clearly indicates the primary operation being performed.

2. **`performInsertReturning`** - This method specifically prepares and executes an insert statement and then extracts generated values. The name adequately describes the method's functionality, indicating that it performs an insert and then handles the return of generated values.

3. **`executeAndExtract`** - As a deprecated method, its purpose is to execute an SQL statement and extract generated values, ultimately returning the generated values. Even though deprecated, the name still aptly describes its functionality.

4. **`executeAndExtractReturning`** - This abstract method describes its core function of executing an SQL statement and extracting returning values. The name is descriptive of its function and does not suggest a need for refactoring.

5. **`releaseStatement`** - This method manages the release of the prepared statement and handles post-statement execution clean-up. The name accurately reflects its functionality.

Considering the refactoring pattern that aims to align method names with their functionalities, the existing method names in your provided code are already quite descriptive and consistent with their respective implementations. Therefore, no rename method refactoring is necessary for this code snippet. Each method name clearly communicates the intent and actions of the method, which is ideal for maintaining readability and understandability in the code.
