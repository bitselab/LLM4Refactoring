The method in question, `performInsert`, is primarily concerned with logging details of a SQL statement, setting up value bindings before the SQL statement is executed, and then executing the SQL statement to insert data, handling the output of this execution. Here’s a breakdown of the method's responsibilities:

1. **Logging the SQL Statement**: This is indicated by the call to `logStatement`.
2. **Preparing the Bindings**: Adjusting the bindings before executing the statement (`valueBindings.beforeStatement`).
3. **Executing the SQL Statement and Handling Return Values**: The method then executes the SQL statement (`executeAndExtractReturning`) and handles the return values.

Given the method’s responsibilities, its current name, `performInsert`, is quite descriptive as it conveys the action of performing an insert operation into a database, which involves preparing, executing, and processing the return of an SQL insert statement.

### Analysis for Refactoring
- **Consistency with Method Body**: The name `performInsert` correctly reflects the sequence of operations being performed in the method and is consistent with the method’s functionality.
- **Readability and Clarity**: The name is clear and conveys the purpose of the method to the reader without ambiguity.
- **Alignment with Conventional Practices**: In JDBC and similar database interaction contexts, method names like `performInsert` are standard and align well with what developers expect for such operations.

### Conclusion
No refactoring is necessary for the method name `performInsert`. It is well-named with respect to the actions performed within the method, providing clarity and consistency.
