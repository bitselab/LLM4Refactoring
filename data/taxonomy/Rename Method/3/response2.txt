The provided code snippet is a test method designed to verify the behavior of the `DiffResult` class, particularly focusing on handling of `null` styles. Here's an analysis regarding renaming the method based on its functionality:

**Current Method Name**: `testNullStyle`
- **Responsibility**: This method tests the `DiffResult`'s ability to handle and use `ToStringStyle.DEFAULT_STYLE`.
- **Action**: It checks that the `ToStringStyle` used in `DiffResult` is as expected after initializing with default settings.

### Assessment:
The name `testNullStyle` might be a bit misleading as it suggests the method tests handling of a null `ToStringStyle`, but actually, it tests the default style handling in `DiffResult`. If renaming is considered to better reflect the method's functionality, a more appropriate name could be considered.

### Possible Rename:
- **Proposed New Name**: `testDefaultToStringStyle`
  - **Reason**: This name makes it clearer that the method is testing the behavior of the `DiffResult` when the `ToStringStyle.DEFAULT_STYLE` is applied, not necessarily a `null` style.

### Refactored Code:
```java
@Test
public void testDefaultToStringStyle() {
    final DiffResult<SimpleClass> diffResult = new DiffResult<>(SIMPLE_TRUE, SIMPLE_FALSE, SIMPLE_TRUE.diff(SIMPLE_FALSE).getDiffs(),
            ToStringStyle.DEFAULT_STYLE, DiffBuilder.TO_STRING_FORMAT);
    assertEquals(ToStringStyle.DEFAULT_STYLE, diffResult.getToStringStyle());
}
```

This renaming makes the test's purpose clearer to any developer or reviewer, enhancing code readability and maintaining alignment with the practices of good identifier naming.
