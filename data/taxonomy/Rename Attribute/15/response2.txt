In the provided code for the `StrictRunner` class, the refactorings that can be made to improve consistency with other method names or attributes within the same class should be carefully considered. Here are some considerations:

1. **Attribute Naming Consistency**: All attributes should follow a consistent naming pattern that clearly communicates their purpose and matches related methods or other attributes in terms of naming convention.

2. **Method Name Consistency**: Methods should be named in a way that they clearly describe the action they perform and are consistent with the naming of attributes they interact with.

Let's analyze the given attributes and methods:
- `private final Class<?> testClass;`
- `private final InternalRunner runner;`
- `private boolean filterRequested;`

The attribute names are quite straightforward:
- `testClass` describes the class type being tested.
- `runner` likely refers to the entity responsible for running the tests.
- `filterRequested` controls whether a filter is applied during the test run.

The method `run(RunNotifier notifier)` uses local instances of `UnnecessaryStubbingsReporter` and `FailureDetector`, which are named descriptively and consistently with their classes. This method's responsibility is clear: it runs the test while managing test notifications and handling unnecessary stubbings and failure detection.

Considering the current naming conventions in the `StrictRunner` class, here's an assessment:

- `testClass`, `runner`, and `filterRequested` are named appropriately and provide a clear understanding of their roles within the class.
- The method `run` is also appropriately named, aligning well with its functionality.

**Potential Refactoring:**
One potential refactoring could be renaming `filterRequested` to `isFilterRequested` to indicate more clearly that it is a boolean flag. This aligns with common Java naming conventions for boolean variables, which often start with "is" or "has" to denote a condition.

Here is the refactored code with this change:
```java
public class StrictRunner implements InternalRunner {

    private final Class<?> testClass;
    private final InternalRunner runner;
    private boolean isFilterRequested; // Renamed for clarity as a boolean flag

    @Override
    public void run(RunNotifier notifier) {
        UnnecessaryStubbingsReporter reporter = new UnnecessaryStubbingsReporter();
        FailureDetector listener = new FailureDetector();

        Mockito.framework().addListener(reporter);
        try {
            notifier.addListener(listener);
            runner.run(notifier);
        } finally {
            Mockito.framework().removeListener(reporter);
        }

        if (!isFilterRequested && listener.isSuccessful()) {
            reporter.validateUnusedStubs(testClass, notifier);
        }
    }
}
```

This change makes the purpose of `isFilterRequested` clearer as a condition-checking flag, and it may improve readability slightly without altering the function of the code. Other than this, the existing names are already well-suited to their purpose and environment.
