The code for `RetryCache` class needs to be reviewed to identify if there are any attributes whose names can be improved to better reflect their purpose or consistency with method names. Let's analyze the code:

1. **LOG**: A standard name for a logger object, clearly indicating its purpose. No change needed.
2. **retryCacheMetrics**: Accurately named to describe its purpose; it relates directly to the metrics for this particular cache. No change needed.
3. **MAX_CAPACITY**: A clear constant name indicating the maximum capacity of the cache. No change needed.
4. **set**: This attribute stores the actual cache entries but the name `set` is quite generic and does not clearly express its purpose. A better name might be `cacheEntries`.
5. **expirationTime**: Clearly named, directly describes its function as the expiration time for cache entries. No change needed.
6. **cacheName**: Directly descriptive of its purpose. No change needed.

Considering the renaming pattern for attributes to better align with method names or clarify purpose, we can rename `set` to `cacheEntries` to make it more descriptive of what it actually holds. Here is the refactored code:

```java
@InterfaceAudience.Private
public class RetryCache {
    public static final Logger LOG = LoggerFactory.getLogger(RetryCache.class);
    private final RetryCacheMetrics retryCacheMetrics;
    private static final int MAX_CAPACITY = 16;

    private LightWeightCache<CacheEntry, CacheEntry> cacheEntries; // Renamed from set
    private final long expirationTime;
    private final String cacheName;

    public RetryCache(String cacheName, double percentage, long expirationTime) {
        int capacity = LightWeightGSet.computeCapacity(percentage, cacheName);
        capacity = Math.max(capacity, MAX_CAPACITY);
        this.cacheEntries = new LightWeightCache<CacheEntry, CacheEntry>(capacity, capacity, expirationTime, 0);
        this.expirationTime = expirationTime;
        this.cacheName = cacheName;
        this.retryCacheMetrics = RetryCacheMetrics.create(this);
    }
}
```

The refactoring focuses on making the `set` attribute name more descriptive by renaming it to `cacheEntries`, which better indicates that it stores cache entries.
