Analyzing the provided code snippet for the `DiffBuilder` class, we will look for opportunities to rename attributes to align with naming conventions and enhance code readability, similar to the renaming pattern you described.

Here's the original snippet:
```java
public class DiffBuilder<T> implements Builder<DiffResult<T>> {

    static final String TO_STRING_FORMAT = "%s differs from %s";

    private final List<Diff<?>> diffs;
    private final boolean objectsEquals;
    private final T left;
    private final T right;
    private final ToStringStyle style;
    private final String toStringFormat;

}
```

### Assessment of Attributes:
1. **TO_STRING_FORMAT** - This static final string clearly defines a format used presumably for outputting differences between objects. It follows a common naming convention for constants and seems appropriately named.
2. **diffs** - A list containing differences; the name is succinct and relevant.
3. **objectsEquals** - Indicates whether the objects being compared are equal. The name is clear but could be adjusted for grammatical accuracy.
4. **left** and **right** - Used to denote the two entities being compared; these are straightforward and match commonly accepted terms in comparison contexts.
5. **style** - Presumably a styling configuration for output; the name could potentially be more descriptive.
6. **toStringFormat** - This duplicates the role of `TO_STRING_FORMAT` but as an instance variable, which might be unnecessary or confusing.

### Suggested Refactoring:
- **Rename `objectsEquals` to `objectsAreEqual`** to improve grammatical correctness and readability.
- **Rename `style` to `toStringStyle`** to clarify its usage related to the string representation.
- **Evaluate the necessity of `toStringFormat`** given that `TO_STRING_FORMAT` seems to serve the same purpose. If `toStringFormat` is modifiable and serves a different purpose than `TO_STRING_FORMAT`, keeping it is justified, but its purpose should be clarified in comments or documentation.

### Refactored Code:
```java
public class DiffBuilder<T> implements Builder<DiffResult<T>> {

    static final String TO_STRING_FORMAT = "%s differs from %s";

    private final List<Diff<?>> diffs;
    private final boolean objectsAreEqual;  // Renamed for grammatical accuracy
    private final T left;
    private final T right;
    private final ToStringStyle toStringStyle;  // Renamed for clarity
    private final String toStringFormat;  // Evaluate necessity and clarify purpose

}
```

This refactoring aligns with the goal of improving readability and clarity, following the patterns seen in your previous example.
