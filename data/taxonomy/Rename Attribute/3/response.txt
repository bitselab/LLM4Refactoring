Upon reviewing the provided code snippet from the `DiffBuilder` class, the primary focus of the review is to identify renaming opportunities for attributes that would align them better with the naming conventions or improve consistency across the codebase.

### Assessment and Recommendations:

1. **Attribute Naming Consistency:**
   The attributes such as `leftS` and `rightS` within the `SDiff` static nested class use abbreviated names which can be slightly ambiguous and inconsistent with other naming practices in the class which are more descriptive. For instance:
   - `leftS` could be renamed to `leftSupplier` 
   - `rightS` could be renamed to `rightSupplier`

   These changes will enhance readability by making the variables' purposes clearer in the context of their usage.

2. **Use of Abbreviations:**
   The variable `objectsEquals` might be more clearly named `objectsAreEqual` to more precisely reflect its usage as a boolean status flag.

3. **General Readability:**
   The variable `toStringFormat` is used to specify a format for output strings. It could be renamed to `outputFormat` to align with its purpose more clearly, especially given that it is used in contexts where output formatting is relevant.

### Refactored Code:

Hereâ€™s how the code would look after applying the suggested refactorings:

```java
package org.apache.commons.lang3.builder;

import java.util.ArrayList;
import java.util.Arrays;
import java.util.List;
import java.util.Objects;
import java.util.function.Supplier;

import org.apache.commons.lang3.ArrayUtils;
import org.apache.commons.lang3.ObjectUtils;

public class DiffBuilder<T> implements Builder<DiffResult<T>> {

    private static final class SDiff<T> extends Diff<T> {

        private static final long serialVersionUID = 1L;
        private final transient Supplier<T> leftSupplier;
        private final transient Supplier<T> rightSupplier;

        private SDiff(final String fieldName, final Supplier<T> leftSupplier, final Supplier<T> rightSupplier, final Class<T> type) {
            super(fieldName, type);
            this.leftSupplier = leftSupplier;
            this.rightSupplier = rightSupplier;
        }

        @Override
        public T getLeft() {
            return leftSupplier.get();
        }

        @Override
        public T getRight() {
            return rightSupplier.get();
        }

    }
    static final String TO_STRING_FORMAT = "%s differs from %s";

    private final List<Diff<?>> diffs;
    private final boolean objectsAreEqual;
    private final T left;
    private final T right;
    private final ToStringStyle style;
    private final String outputFormat;

    public DiffBuilder(final T lhs, final T rhs, final ToStringStyle style) {
        this(lhs, rhs, style, true);
    }

    public DiffBuilder(final T lhs, final T rhs, final ToStringStyle style, final boolean testObjectsEquals) {
        this.left = Objects.requireNonNull(lhs, "lhs");
        this.right = Objects.requireNonNull(rhs, "rhs");
        this.diffs = new ArrayList<>();
        this.outputFormat = DiffBuilder.TO_STRING_FORMAT;
        this.style = style != null ? style : ToStringStyle.DEFAULT_STYLE;
        this.objectsAreEqual = testObjectsEquals && Objects.equals(lhs, rhs);
    }

    private <F> DiffBuilder<T> add(final String fieldName, final Supplier<F> left, final Supplier<F> right, final Class<F> type) {
        diffs.add(new SDiff<>(Objects.requireNonNull(fieldName, "fieldName"), left, right, type));
        return this;
    }

    // Remaining methods continue as before with adjusted variable names where appropriate.

    @Override
    public DiffResult<T> build() {
        return new DiffResult<>(left, right, diffs, style, outputFormat);
    }
}
```

This refactoring primarily improves the readability and clarity of the code by enhancing the descriptiveness of variable names.
