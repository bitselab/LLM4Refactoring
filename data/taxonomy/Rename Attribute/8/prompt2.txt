Rename attribute refactorings are frequently employed to modify low-quality identifiers to improve readability.
##################################################
A rename attribute refactoring pattern is to rename attributes that do not conform to the naming convention. Here is an example of the rename attribute refactoring that follows this pattern.
The source code before refactoring is:
```
public class StoreFactoryTest
{
    @Rule
    public final PageCacheRule pageCacheRule = new PageCacheRule();
    @Rule
    public TargetDirectory.TestDirectory testDirectory = TargetDirectory.testDirForTest( getClass() );
    private StoreFactory storeFactory;
    private NeoStore neostore;
}
```
The source code after refactoring is:
```
public class StoreFactoryTest
{
    @Rule
    public final PageCacheRule pageCacheRule = new PageCacheRule();
    @Rule
    public TargetDirectory.TestDirectory testDirectory = TargetDirectory.testDirForTest( getClass() );
    private StoreFactory storeFactory;
    private NeoStore neoStore;
}
```
In this example, the developer renamed the attribute "neostore" to "neoStore".

As a developer, imagine your team leader requests you to review a piece of code to identify potential rename attribute refactoring opportunities that follows the refactoring pattern above. The original code snippet is as follows:
```
public class HibernateSearchKnnVectorsFormat extends KnnVectorsFormat {
    public static final int DEFAULT_MAX_DIMENSIONS = KnnVectorsFormat.DEFAULT_MAX_DIMENSIONS;
    private static final KnnVectorsFormat DEFAULT_KNN_VECTORS_FORMAT = new HibernateSearchKnnVectorsFormat();

    public static KnnVectorsFormat defaultFormat() {
        return DEFAULT_KNN_VECTORS_FORMAT;
    }

    private final KnnVectorsFormat delegate;
    private final int maxConn;

    private final int beamWidth;

}
```
If there are any refactoring opportunities, please do it and generate the refactored code. Otherwise, simply state that no refactoring is necessary.
