The original code snippet you provided already adheres to common Java naming conventions for variables and attributes. However, we can examine each variable to ensure that it follows camelCase naming for non-constant attributes and UPPER_SNAKE_CASE for constants, which is the standard in Java.

### Analysis of the Variables:

1. `DEFAULT_MAX_DIMENSIONS` - This is a constant (`public static final`) and is correctly formatted in UPPER_SNAKE_CASE.
2. `DEFAULT_KNN_VECTORS_FORMAT` - Also a constant and correctly uses UPPER_SNAKE_CASE.
3. `delegate` - A non-constant attribute using camelCase, which is appropriate.
4. `maxConn` - This attribute appears to use camelCase, but the abbreviation "Conn" might not be clear. We could consider renaming it to `maxConnections` for better readability.
5. `beamWidth` - Uses camelCase correctly and is clear.

### Suggested Refactoring:

The only attribute that might benefit from renaming for clarity is `maxConn`, which could be renamed to `maxConnections` to improve understandability. This change would make the variable's purpose more explicit.

### Refactored Code:

```java
public class HibernateSearchKnnVectorsFormat extends KnnVectorsFormat {
    public static final int DEFAULT_MAX_DIMENSIONS = KnnVectorsFormat.DEFAULT_MAX_DIMENSIONS;
    private static final KnnVectorsFormat DEFAULT_KNN_VECTORS_FORMAT = new HibernateSearchKnnVectorsFormat();

    public static KnnVectorsFormat defaultFormat() {
        return DEFAULT_KNN_VECTORS_FORMAT;
    }

    private final KnnVectorsFormat delegate;
    private final int maxConnections; // Renamed for clarity

    private final int beamWidth;

}
```

This change enhances the readability of the code by making the purpose of `maxConnections` more transparent. Other than this, no additional rename attribute refactorings are necessary for this snippet.
