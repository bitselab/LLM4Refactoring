The original code snippet for `MetadataDataStreamsService` involves the following attributes:
```java
public class MetadataDataStreamsService {
    private final ClusterService clusterService;
    private final IndicesService indicesService;
    private final MasterServiceTaskQueue<UpdateLifecycleTask> taskQueue;
    private final MasterServiceTaskQueue<SetRolloverOnWriteTask> setRolloverOnWriteTaskQueue;
}
```

Analyzing this snippet:
- The identifiers `clusterService` and `indicesService` are clear and straightforward, following good naming conventions for service-type components.
- The identifiers for `taskQueue` and `setRolloverOnWriteTaskQueue` are both related to `MasterServiceTaskQueue`, but they serve different purposes and handle different types of tasks.

Refactoring Suggestions:
- Renaming `taskQueue` to `updateLifecycleTaskQueue` would make the purpose of this attribute clearer and align the naming convention with `setRolloverOnWriteTaskQueue`. This follows the pattern of being specific about the type of tasks handled by each queue, enhancing code readability and maintainability.

Here is the refactored code:
```java
public class MetadataDataStreamsService {
    private final ClusterService clusterService;
    private final IndicesService indicesService;
    private final MasterServiceTaskQueue<UpdateLifecycleTask> updateLifecycleTaskQueue;
    private final MasterServiceTaskQueue<SetRolloverOnWriteTask> setRolloverOnWriteTaskQueue;
}
```

This change increases consistency across attribute names and clarifies the distinct roles of the two task queues.
