In the provided code snippet, we are reviewing a `MapValueResolver` class for potential attribute renaming that would align better with its usage or related methods. The class contains a single attribute, `values`, which is a `Map<String, Object>`. The methods in this class are:

1. `resolveValue(String name, Class<?> type)` - Retrieves a value from the `Map` based on the provided `name`.
2. `getNames()` - Returns a set of keys from the `Map`.

Given the methods' functionalities and the nature of the data stored (keys and values from a map), the attribute name `values` is quite descriptive of what it holds. It aligns with the methods that operate directly on these values and keys.

However, to ensure the attribute name is even clearer and to follow the idea of renaming to enhance consistency and readability, a possible renaming could be:

- Rename `values` to `valueMap` or `mappedValues` to indicate explicitly that this attribute is a mapping structure, which might make the relationship between the attribute and the methods like `resolveValue` and `getNames` even clearer, emphasizing that the operations are map-specific.

Here is how the refactored code would look if we rename `values` to `valueMap`:

```java
private static class MapValueResolver implements DataBinder.ValueResolver {

    private final Map<String, Object> valueMap;

    private MapValueResolver(Map<String, Object> map) {
        this.valueMap = map;
    }

    @Override
    public Object resolveValue(String name, Class<?> type) {
        return valueMap.get(name);
    }

    @Override
    public Set<String> getNames() {
        return this.valueMap.keySet();
    }
}
```

This renaming makes the nature of the data structure (a map) explicit and may improve readability and clarity, especially for new developers or those unfamiliar with the class.
