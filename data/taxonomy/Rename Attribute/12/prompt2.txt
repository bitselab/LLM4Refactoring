Rename attribute refactorings are frequently employed to modify low-quality identifiers to improve readability.
##################################################
A rename attribute refactoring pattern is to rename attributes that do not conform to the naming convention. Here is an example of the rename attribute refactoring that follows this pattern.
The source code before refactoring is:
```
public class StoreFactoryTest
{
    @Rule
    public final PageCacheRule pageCacheRule = new PageCacheRule();
    @Rule
    public TargetDirectory.TestDirectory testDirectory = TargetDirectory.testDirForTest( getClass() );
    private StoreFactory storeFactory;
    private NeoStore neostore;
}
```
The source code after refactoring is:
```
public class StoreFactoryTest
{
    @Rule
    public final PageCacheRule pageCacheRule = new PageCacheRule();
    @Rule
    public TargetDirectory.TestDirectory testDirectory = TargetDirectory.testDirForTest( getClass() );
    private StoreFactory storeFactory;
    private NeoStore neoStore;
}
```
In this example, the developer renamed the attribute "neostore" to "neoStore".

As a developer, imagine your team leader requests you to review a piece of code to identify potential rename attribute refactoring opportunities that follows the refactoring pattern above. The original code snippet is as follows:
```
public final class BitmapWalker {

    private final ObjectWalk walker;

    private final BitmapIndex bitmapIndex;

    private final ProgressMonitor pm;

    private long countOfBitmapIndexMisses;

    // Cached bitmap and commit to save walk time.
    private AnyObjectId prevCommit;

    private Bitmap prevBitmap;

    public static final BitmapWalkListener NO_LISTENER = new BitmapWalkListener() {
        @Override
        public void onCommitSeen(ObjectId oid) {
            // Nothing to do
        }

        @Override
        public void onCommitWithBitmap(ObjectId oid) {
            // Nothing to do
        }

        @Override
        public void onCommitWithoutBitmap(ObjectId oid) {
            // Nothing to do
        }
    };

    private final BitmapWalkListener listener;

}
```
If there are any refactoring opportunities, please do it and generate the refactored code. Otherwise, simply state that no refactoring is necessary.
