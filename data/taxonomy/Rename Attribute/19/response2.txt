In the provided code snippet, attribute names should ideally be consistent and descriptive enough to clearly indicate their purpose and type. Here's a review of the attributes:

1. `PemSslStoreDetails details`: This name appears to be consistent with its type (`PemSslStoreDetails`). It's descriptive, indicating that it holds details relevant to `PemSslStore`.

2. `Supplier<List<X509Certificate>> certificates`: The attribute name `certificates` sufficiently describes what it suppliesâ€”`List<X509Certificate>`. However, the name might be enhanced to reflect that it is a supplier, not a direct list of certificates.

3. `Supplier<PrivateKey> privateKeySupplier`: This attribute is named appropriately, clearly indicating that it supplies a `PrivateKey`.

Considering the refactoring pattern of renaming attributes to be consistent with their types, here is a suggested refactoring to make the attribute names more explicit about their nature as suppliers:

```java
final class LoadedPemSslStore implements PemSslStore {

    private final PemSslStoreDetails details;

    private final Supplier<List<X509Certificate>> certificateSupplier;

    private final Supplier<PrivateKey> privateKeySupplier;
}
```

In this refactoring, I've renamed `certificates` to `certificateSupplier` to make it clear that it's not a direct list of certificates but a supplier providing them. This enhances readability and consistency, aligning with the pattern discussed.
