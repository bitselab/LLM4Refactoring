Rename attribute refactorings are frequently employed to modify low-quality identifiers to improve readability.
##################################################
A rename attribute refactoring pattern is to rename attributes whose semantics are inconsistent with their usage in methods. Here is an example of the rename attribute refactoring that follows this pattern.
The source code before refactoring is:
```
public class ReactNativeBundle extends AbstractBuildRule implements AbiRule {
    @AddToRuleKey
    private final SourcePath entryPath;
    @AddToRuleKey
    private final boolean isDevMode;
    @AddToRuleKey
    private final SourcePath jsPackager;
    @AddToRuleKey
    private final ReactNativePlatform platform;
    @AddToRuleKey
    private final String bundleName;
    private final ReactNativeDeps depsFinder;
    private final Path jsOutput;
    private final Path resource;
    
    protected ReactNativeBundle(
        BuildRuleParams ruleParams,
        SourcePathResolver resolver,
        SourcePath entryPath,
        boolean isDevMode,
        String bundleName,
        SourcePath jsPackager,
        ReactNativePlatform platform,
        ReactNativeDeps depsFinder) {
      super(ruleParams, resolver);
      this.entryPath = entryPath;
      this.isDevMode = isDevMode;
      this.bundleName = bundleName;
      this.jsPackager = jsPackager;
      this.platform = platform;
      this.depsFinder = depsFinder;
      BuildTarget buildTarget = ruleParams.getBuildTarget();
      this.jsOutput = getPathToJSBundleDir(buildTarget);
      this.resource = getPathToResources(buildTarget);
    }
}
```
The source code after refactoring is:
```
public class ReactNativeBundle extends AbstractBuildRule implements AbiRule {
    @AddToRuleKey
    private final SourcePath entryPath;
    @AddToRuleKey
    private final boolean isDevMode;
    @AddToRuleKey
    private final SourcePath jsPackager;
    @AddToRuleKey
    private final ReactNativePlatform platform;
    @AddToRuleKey
    private final String bundleName;
    private final ReactNativeDeps depsFinder;
    private final Path jsOutputDir;
    private final Path resource;

    protected ReactNativeBundle(
        BuildRuleParams ruleParams,
        SourcePathResolver resolver,
        SourcePath entryPath,
        boolean isDevMode,
        String bundleName,
        SourcePath jsPackager,
        ReactNativePlatform platform,
        ReactNativeDeps depsFinder) {
      super(ruleParams, resolver);
      this.entryPath = entryPath;
      this.isDevMode = isDevMode;
      this.bundleName = bundleName;
      this.jsPackager = jsPackager;
      this.platform = platform;
      this.depsFinder = depsFinder;
      BuildTarget buildTarget = ruleParams.getBuildTarget();
      this.jsOutputDir = getPathToJSBundleDir(buildTarget);
      this.resource = getPathToResources(buildTarget);
    }
}
```
In this example, the developer renamed the attribute "jsOutput" to "jsOutputDir".

As a developer, imagine your team leader requests you to review a piece of code to identify potential rename attribute refactoring opportunities that follows the refactoring pattern above. The original code snippet is as follows:
```
public static class Builder {
    protected Http2SolrClient client;
    protected String baseSolrUrl;
    protected String defaultCollection;
    protected int queueSize = 10;
    protected int threadCount;
    protected ExecutorService executorService;
    protected boolean streamDeletes;
    protected boolean closeHttp2Client;
    private long pollQueueTimeMillis;

    public Builder withDefaultDataStore(String defaultCoreOrCollection) {
        this.defaultCollection = defaultCoreOrCollection;
        return this;
    }
}
```
If there are any refactoring opportunities, please do it and generate the refactored code. Otherwise, simply state that no refactoring is necessary.
