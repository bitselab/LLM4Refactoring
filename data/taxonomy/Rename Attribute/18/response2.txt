In the provided code snippet for the `Builder` class, we're looking for rename attribute refactoring opportunities to improve readability and consistency with method names within the same class.

Upon examining the existing attributes and method:

- `baseSolrUrl` might suggest a change to enhance its consistency or clarity, especially given its relation to the `Http2SolrClient` and Solr-specific operations. 
- `defaultCollection` is modified by a method named `withDefaultDataStore`. The method name suggests that it might handle more than just collections, potentially handling cores as well. Hence, renaming the attribute to something more general, like `defaultDataStore`, could improve clarity.

Here's the refactored code:
```java
public static class Builder {
    protected Http2SolrClient client;
    protected String solrBaseUrl;  // Renamed to clarify that this is a base URL related to Solr.
    protected String defaultDataStore;  // Renamed for consistency with the method name that modifies it.
    protected int queueSize = 10;
    protected int threadCount;
    protected ExecutorService executorService;
    protected boolean streamDeletes;
    protected boolean closeHttp2Client;
    private long pollQueueTimeMillis;

    public Builder withDefaultDataStore(String defaultCoreOrCollection) {
        this.defaultDataStore = defaultCoreOrCollection;
        return this;
    }
}
```
In this refactoring:
- `baseSolrUrl` has been changed to `solrBaseUrl`, which slightly adjusts the wording to maintain the clarity of the URL's purpose related to Solr specifically.
- `defaultCollection` has been changed to `defaultDataStore` to align with the method `withDefaultDataStore`, thereby reflecting its broader potential use for either cores or collections in Solr.
