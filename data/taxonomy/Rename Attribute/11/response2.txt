Reviewing the `WebSocketCoreClient` class provided, let's analyze the attribute names to determine if any refinements are necessary to improve consistency or clarity, following the rename attribute refactoring pattern.

Here are the current attributes in the class:
1. `WEBSOCKET_CORECLIENT_ATTRIBUTE` - This attribute name is explicit and relates directly to the class name, which is a good practice for constants used to represent attribute names.
2. `LOG` - This is a conventional name used for logging in Java, typically understood across different codebases.
3. `httpClient` - This attribute name is clear and descriptive of its purpose.
4. `components` - This attribute represents the `WebSocketComponents` used within the client. The name is relatively clear, but could be made more explicit.

Considering the rename attribute refactoring pattern where the objective is to align attribute names with similar naming conventions, the existing attribute names are already appropriately named for their roles and usage. However, to follow through with the pattern exemplified earlier (where `DEFAULT_MAX_REQUESTS_PER_HOST_LOCAL` was changed to `DEFAULT_MAX_REQUESTS_PER_CONNECTION_LOCAL` for better alignment), we could potentially make the following adjustment for better clarity:
- Rename `components` to `webSocketComponents` to directly reflect the class name of the object it's referencing, thereby improving readability and consistency in reference to the type of component it is.

Here is the refactored code with this suggested change:

```java
public class WebSocketCoreClient extends ContainerLifeCycle
{
    public static final String WEBSOCKET_CORECLIENT_ATTRIBUTE = WebSocketCoreClient.class.getName();

    private static final Logger LOG = LoggerFactory.getLogger(WebSocketCoreClient.class);
    private final HttpClient httpClient;
    private final WebSocketComponents webSocketComponents;  // Renamed for clarity and consistency
    private ClassLoader classLoader;

    // Constructor and other methods would be updated accordingly to reflect the renamed attribute
}
```

This change enhances the clarity and maintainability of the code by making the attribute name more descriptive of its type and purpose. This small adjustment follows the pattern of using more descriptive names to align with the nature of the objects they reference.
