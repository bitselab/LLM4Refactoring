Inline method refactorings are frequently employed to eliminate unnecessary methods to improve readability. As a developer, imagine your team leader requests you to review a piece of code to identify potential inline method refactoring opportunities. The original code snippet is as follows:
```
package org.junit.jupiter.params.converter;

class StringToEnumConverter implements StringToObjectConverter {

    @Override
    public boolean canConvert(Class<?> targetType) {
        return targetType.isEnum();
    }

    @Override
    public Object convert(String source, Class<?> targetType) throws Exception {
        return valueOf(targetType, source);
    }

    @SuppressWarnings({ "unchecked", "rawtypes" })
    private static Object valueOf(Class targetType, String source) {
        return Enum.valueOf(targetType, source);
    }

}
```
If there are any refactoring opportunities, please do it and generate the refactored code. Otherwise, simply state that no refactoring is necessary.
